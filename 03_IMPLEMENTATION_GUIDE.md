## Phase 1 Implementation

### Step 1: Create CLAUDE.md

**File**: `CLAUDE.md`

```markdown
# {Project Title} - Fiction Writing Project

## Project Type
Fiction writing project using the Fiction Writing Skills System.

## Core Principles
1. **Character voice consistency**: All prose must match character profiles
2. **World rule enforcement**: No violations of established world rules
3. **Scene structure**: Every scene follows Story Grid Five Commandments
4. **Human-sounding prose**: Avoid AI writing patterns

## Key Directories

### Reference (Read for Context)
- `bible/` - Story bible, world rules, scene tracker
- `characters/` - Character profiles with voice guides
- `skills/definitions/` - Skill specifications (YAML)

### Working (Read/Write)
- `chapters/` - Scene outlines, blueprints, drafts

## Skills Available
- `/project:skills:scene-architect` - Generate scene blueprint from outline
- `/project:skills:scene-draft` - Generate prose from blueprint
- `/project:skills:character-truth` - Audit draft for character consistency
- `/project:pipeline-run` - Run full pipeline with review pauses

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice Enforcement
When writing prose for a POV character:
1. Read their character profile, especially Voice Profile section
2. Filter all observations through their worldview
3. Use vocabulary matching their education/background
4. Maintain their internal monologue style

### World Rule Enforcement
Before writing:
1. Check `bible/world-rules.md` for constraints
2. Verify geography (what exists where)
3. Confirm magic/technology limits
4. Check scene-tracker for character knowledge state

### Anti-AI Prose Checklist
Every draft must:
- [ ] Vary sentence length (short, medium, long)
- [ ] Include non-visual sensory details (2+ per scene)
- [ ] Use specific concrete details, not generic descriptions
- [ ] Avoid AI vocabulary list (see below)
- [ ] Match POV character's voice throughout

### AI Vocabulary to Avoid
Never use these unless they appear in character's voice profile:
delve, multifaceted, navigate, foster, embark, journey, landscape, 
testament, unwavering, intricate, beacon, realm, pivotal, nuance, 
crucial, indispensable, comprehensive, furthermore, consequently, 
hence, vital, commendable, meticulous, endeavor, profound, enhance

## Workflow
1. Create/update story bible before writing
2. Create character profiles before they appear
3. Write scene outline
4. Run pipeline: `/project:pipeline-run {scene-path}`
5. Review and edit between each stage
6. Commit to git after each stage
```

---

### Step 2: Create Skill Command Files

#### 2.1 Scene Architect Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/skills/scene-architect.md`

```markdown
# Scene Architect

Generate a structured scene blueprint from an outline or idea.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:scene-architect {scene-directory}
```

Example: `/project:skills:scene-architect chapters/ch01/scene-01/`

## Process

### 1. Gather Input
Check for `{scene-directory}/outline.md`. If missing, prompt:
- Scene idea/description (50-500 words)
- POV character name
- Other characters present
- Scene's purpose in story (optional)

### 2. Load Context
Read these files:
- `bible/story-bible.md` - for story structure, theme
- `bible/scene-tracker.md` - for continuity (what happened before)
- `characters/{pov-character}.md` - POV character profile
- `characters/{character}.md` - for each present character

### 3. Generate Blueprint
Create `{scene-directory}/blueprint.md` with:

```markdown
# Scene Blueprint: {Scene Name}

## Scene Metadata
- **POV Character**: {from input}
- **Characters Present**: {from input}
- **Location**: {inferred or ask}
- **Time**: {inferred or ask}

## Scene Purpose
- **Story Function**: {advances plot / reveals character / reveals setting / reveals context}
- **Value at Stake**: {life/death, love/hate, freedom/captivity, truth/lie, etc.}
- **Opening Value**: {+ or -}
- **Closing Value**: {opposite of opening}

## Five Commandments

### 1. Inciting Incident
- **Type**: {causal or coincidental}
- **Description**: {what disrupts the status quo}
- **What changes**: {the disturbance that starts the scene}

### 2. Progressive Complications
- **Complication 1**: {first obstacle/revelation}
- **Complication 2**: {second obstacle/revelation}
- **Complication 3**: {if needed}
- **Turning Point**: {the complication that forces a choice}
- **Type**: {active (character does something) or revelatory (character learns something)}

### 3. Crisis
- **Type**: {Best Bad Choice OR Irreconcilable Goods}
- **Question**: {Character} must choose between {Option A} or {Option B}
- **Stakes of A**: {what happens if they choose A}
- **Stakes of B**: {what happens if they choose B}
- **Why It's Hard**: {why neither option is easy}

### 4. Climax
- **Choice Made**: {which option the character chooses}
- **Action Taken**: {the concrete action that results}

### 5. Resolution
- **Immediate Consequence**: {what happens right after}
- **Value Shift Achieved**: {Opening Value} → {Closing Value}
- **Setup for Next**: {what this scene sets up}

## Scene Notes
### POV Character's Scene Goal
{What the POV character wants in this scene}

### Obstacles
{What prevents them from getting it easily}

### Sensory Anchor
{A specific sensory detail to ground the scene - setting element}

### Key Props/Objects
{Any objects that matter in this scene}

### Emotional Journey
{How the POV character's emotional state changes}
```

### 4. Validate
Confirm:
- [ ] Value shift exists (opening ≠ closing)
- [ ] Crisis is a genuine choice (not obvious answer)
- [ ] Turning point forces the crisis
- [ ] Scene serves at least one story function

### 5. Report
"Blueprint created: `{scene-directory}/blueprint.md`

Review the blueprint and edit if needed. When ready, run:
`/project:skills:scene-draft {scene-directory}`"
```

---

#### 2.2 Scene Draft Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/skills/scene-draft.md`

```markdown
# Scene Draft

Generate full prose draft from a scene blueprint.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:scene-draft {scene-directory}
```

Example: `/project:skills:scene-draft chapters/ch01/scene-01/`

## Process

### 1. Load Required Files
**Required**:
- `{scene-directory}/blueprint.md` - scene structure

**Context** (read all):
- `bible/story-bible.md`
- `bible/world-rules.md`
- `bible/scene-tracker.md`
- `characters/{pov-character}.md` - CRITICAL for voice
- `characters/{character}.md` - for each present character

### 2. Prepare Voice Guidance

Extract from POV character profile:
- Worldview filter (how they see events)
- Internal monologue style
- Vocabulary level
- Key concerns
- What they avoid saying/thinking

### 3. Prepare Constraint Checklist

From world-rules.md, note:
- Geographic constraints
- Technology/magic limits
- Social rules
- Hard constraints (things that MUST NOT happen)

From scene-tracker.md, note:
- What POV character knows
- What POV character has on them
- Recent events affecting them

### 4. Draft Scene

Write prose that:

**Follows Blueprint Structure**
- Opens at Opening Value state
- Inciting Incident disrupts status quo
- Complications build tension
- Crisis forces decision
- Climax shows choice and action
- Resolution lands at Closing Value

**Enforces POV Voice**
- All observations filtered through character's worldview
- Internal monologue matches profile style
- Vocabulary appropriate to character
- Character's concerns/preoccupations present

**Respects World Rules**
- No geographic impossibilities
- Technology/magic within limits
- Characters know only what they should
- Objects tracked correctly

**Avoids AI Patterns**
- NO: delve, multifaceted, navigate, foster, embark, journey, landscape, testament, unwavering, intricate, beacon, realm, pivotal, nuance, crucial, indispensable, comprehensive, furthermore, consequently, hence, vital
- YES: Varied sentence lengths
- YES: 2+ non-visual sensory details
- YES: Specific concrete details (not generic)
- YES: Character-specific word choices

**Prose Quality Checklist**
- [ ] First line hooks
- [ ] Paragraphs vary in length
- [ ] Dialogue has beats/action
- [ ] White space for dramatic moments
- [ ] Ending resonates

### 5. Output

Create `{scene-directory}/draft.md`:

```markdown
# Scene Draft: {Scene Name}

---

{PROSE CONTENT}

---

## Draft Metadata
- **Word Count**: {count}
- **POV Character**: {name}
- **Value Shift**: {Opening} → {Closing}
- **Context Files Referenced**:
  - bible/story-bible.md
  - bible/world-rules.md  
  - characters/{pov}.md
  - {other files}
```

### 6. Report
"Draft created: `{scene-directory}/draft.md`
Word count: {X}

Review the draft and edit if needed. When ready, run:
`/project:skills:character-truth {scene-directory}`"
```

---

#### 2.3 Character Truth Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/skills/character-truth.md`

```markdown
# Character Truth Pass

Audit a scene draft for character consistency.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:character-truth {scene-directory}
```

Example: `/project:skills:character-truth chapters/ch01/scene-01/`

## Process

### 1. Load Files
**Required**:
- `{scene-directory}/draft.md`
- `{scene-directory}/blueprint.md` (for character list)

**For Each Character in Scene**:
- `characters/{character}.md`

**For Knowledge Verification**:
- `bible/scene-tracker.md`

### 2. Perform Audits

#### Voice Consistency Audit (POV Character)
For each paragraph of internal monologue:
- Does worldview filter match profile?
- Is vocabulary appropriate?
- Is internal voice style consistent?
- Any jarring shifts?

Flag format:
```
**Paragraph {N}**: "{excerpt...}"
- **Issue**: {description}
- **Profile says**: {quote from character profile}
- **Suggested fix**: {specific recommendation}
```

#### Dialogue Consistency Audit (All Characters)
For each character's dialogue:
- Speech patterns match profile?
- Verbal tics present where expected?
- Vocabulary appropriate?
- Formality level correct?

Flag format:
```
**{Character Name}, Line {N}**: "{dialogue}"
- **Issue**: {description}
- **Profile says**: {quote from Voice Profile section}
- **Suggested revision**: "{alternative dialogue}"
```

#### Knowledge Verification (All Characters)
For each character:
- Do they reference information they shouldn't have?
- Are they missing information they should have?
- Any impossible knowledge?

Flag format:
```
**{Character Name}**: References {information}
- **Issue**: Character cannot know this because {reason}
- **Scene tracker shows**: {what they actually know}
- **Fix**: {how to handle}
```

#### Behavioral Consistency (All Characters)
For each character's actions:
- Actions align with motivations?
- Capabilities respected?
- Any out-of-character moments?

Flag format:
```
**{Character Name}**: {action taken}
- **Issue**: {why this conflicts with profile}
- **Profile says**: {relevant section}
- **Fix**: {alternative action or justification}
```

### 3. Output

Create `{scene-directory}/audit.md`:

```markdown
# Character Truth Audit: {Scene Name}

## Summary
- **Total Issues Found**: {count}
- **High Severity**: {count} (character would never do/say this)
- **Medium Severity**: {count} (inconsistent but fixable)
- **Low Severity**: {count} (minor polish needed)

## POV Character: {Name}

### Voice Consistency
{findings or "No issues found"}

### Behavioral Consistency  
{findings or "No issues found"}

---

## Supporting Characters

### {Character Name}

#### Dialogue Consistency
{findings or "No issues found"}

#### Knowledge Verification
{findings or "No issues found"}

#### Behavioral Consistency
{findings or "No issues found"}

---

## Clean Passes
The following checks found no issues:
- {list what was checked and passed}

---

## Recommended Actions
1. {Most important fix}
2. {Second most important}
3. {etc.}
```

### 4. Report
"Audit complete: `{scene-directory}/audit.md`

Found {X} issues ({high} high, {medium} medium, {low} low severity).

Review the audit and apply fixes to draft.md. 

When satisfied, the scene is ready for:
- Manual polish and line editing
- Git commit
- Moving to next scene"
```

---

#### 2.4 Pipeline Run Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/pipeline-run.md`

```markdown
# Pipeline Run

Orchestrate the full scene development pipeline with review pauses.

## Usage
```
/project:pipeline-run {scene-directory}
```

Example: `/project:pipeline-run chapters/ch01/scene-01/`

## Process

### 1. Check State
Look for `{scene-directory}/.pipeline-state`

**If not exists**: Initialize new pipeline
**If exists**: Resume from current stage

### 2. State File Format
```yaml
scene: {scene-directory}
current_stage: {1|2|3}
started: {ISO timestamp}
last_updated: {ISO timestamp}
stages:
  1:
    status: {pending|in_progress|complete}
    output: blueprint.md
    completed: {ISO timestamp if complete}
  2:
    status: {pending|in_progress|complete}
    output: draft.md
    completed: {ISO timestamp if complete}
  3:
    status: {pending|in_progress|complete}
    output: audit.md
    completed: {ISO timestamp if complete}
```

### 3. Pipeline Stages

#### Stage 1: Scene Architect
- **Run**: `/project:skills:scene-architect {scene-directory}`
- **Output**: `blueprint.md`
- **After**: Update state, pause for review

Report:
"✅ Stage 1 Complete: Blueprint generated

Output: `{scene-directory}/blueprint.md`

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the blueprint
2. Edit if needed (especially the Crisis - make sure it's a hard choice)
3. Run `/project:pipeline-run {scene-directory}` to continue to drafting

💡 Tip: A strong blueprint makes drafting much easier."

#### Stage 2: Scene Draft
- **Run**: `/project:skills:scene-draft {scene-directory}`
- **Output**: `draft.md`
- **After**: Update state, pause for review

Report:
"✅ Stage 2 Complete: Draft generated

Output: `{scene-directory}/draft.md`
Word Count: {X}

**Next Steps:**
1. Read through the draft
2. Make any line-level edits you want
3. Run `/project:pipeline-run {scene-directory}` to run character consistency audit

💡 Tip: Don't polish too much yet - the audit may find issues to fix first."

#### Stage 3: Character Truth
- **Run**: `/project:skills:character-truth {scene-directory}`
- **Output**: `audit.md`
- **After**: Update state, mark complete

Report:
"✅ Stage 3 Complete: Audit generated

Output: `{scene-directory}/audit.md`
Issues Found: {X} ({severity breakdown})

**Pipeline Complete!**

**Final Steps:**
1. Review the audit
2. Apply fixes to `draft.md`
3. Do your final polish/line editing
4. Commit to git: `git add . && git commit -m 'scene: {scene-name} complete'`
5. Ready for next scene!"

### 4. Edge Cases

**Missing outline.md for Stage 1**:
Prompt for scene input before running scene-architect.

**Missing blueprint.md for Stage 2**:
"Cannot draft without blueprint. Run Stage 1 first:
`/project:skills:scene-architect {scene-directory}`"

**Missing draft.md for Stage 3**:
"Cannot audit without draft. Run Stage 2 first:
`/project:skills:scene-draft {scene-directory}`"

**Already complete**:
"Pipeline already complete for this scene.

To restart, delete `.pipeline-state` and run again.
Or move to next scene: `/project:pipeline-run {next-scene-directory}`"
```

---

### Step 3: Create Templates

#### 3.1 Story Bible Template

**File**: `templates/story-bible.template.md`

```markdown
