  Anchor prose & voice: grounded cinematic realism,
  tight tension, emotionally restrained characters, vivid but controlled imagery,
  and exposition embedded through action and sensory detail.
inputs:
  required:
    - text_to_write_or_edit
  optional:
    - pov_character
    - tense: "past"
    - target_length: "1-2 pages not counting dialogue"
    - tone_intensity: "low|medium|high"
    - taboo_list: "cliches, sexual innuendo, gratuitous profanities, never curse using God or Jesus or Christ"
    - voice_samples: "optional additional samples"
steps:
  - Enforce narrative distance: close-third with occasional widened lens; never float.
  - Open with sensory setting or immediate tension; quickly get to inciting incident; do not begin with abstract reflection.
  - Use concrete imagery with one surprising metaphor max per paragraph (e.g., 'rain like static').
  - Keep sentences mostly lean, mixing short pressure lines with occasional longer flow.
  - Embed backstory in micro-flashes, physical reactions like flinching, forced laugh, touching a scar, reacting to phantom physical pain - triggered by action, objects, memories, places).
  - Maintain emotional restraint: characters rarely label emotions; show through body and choice.
  - Dialogue stays functional, sharp, and sometimes antagonistic/hostile, curious, empathetic, caring depending on character relationships, greatest fear or desire and fitting the situationsl; avoid witty banter unless earned.
  - Escalation should occur through small conflicts, small humiliations, increased stakes, and sudden physical reversals.
  - Avoid generic "AI narrator" descriptions, dialogue, and transitions: no "As they continued..." / "Little did he know..."

  type: text
  structure:
    - "Voice compliance checklist (bullets)"
quality_checks:
  - "Every paragraph contains at least one concrete sensory/physical detail."
  - "No overt emotional labeling unless the POV character would self-label."
  - "Backstory appears as brief, sharp insertions; never as a block."
  - "At least one or two sentence per page is punchy and standalone (pressure line)."
  - "Dialogue reflects power dynamics, character inner emotions rooted in character traits; subtext present when stakes are high."
style_contract:
  do:
    - "Start scenes with inciting incident + immediate stakes (emotional, relational or physical tied to characters' greatest desire or weakness or fear). Or get to those quickly.
    - "Write rising tension through social threat, physical proximity, revelation of character's long kept secret that makes them vulnerable"
    - "Use specific objects (packs, tarps, plastic bags, N95) to ground realism."
    - "Let exposition hide in actions, emotions, memories, setting, significant objects."
  dont:
    - "No lyrical overdescription; no purple prose."
    - "No meta commentary about storytelling."
    - "No perfectly logical dialogue; allow jaggedness."
    - "No convenient coincidences without cost."
