description: >
  Anchor prose to the "Watcher in the Dark" voice: grounded cinematic realism,
  tight tension, emotionally restrained characters, vivid but controlled imagery,
  and exposition embedded through action and sensory detail.
inputs:
  required:
    - text_to_write_or_edit
  optional:
    - pov_character
    - tense: "past"
    - target_length
    - tone_intensity: "low|medium|high"
    - taboo_list: "words/phrases to avoid"
    - voice_samples: "optional additional samples"
steps:
  - Enforce narrative distance: close-third with occasional widened lens; never float.
  - Open with sensory setting or immediate tension; do not begin with abstract reflection.
  - Use concrete imagery with one surprising metaphor max per paragraph (e.g., 'rain like static').
  - Keep sentences mostly lean, mixing short pressure lines with occasional longer flow.
  - Embed backstory in micro-flashes triggered by action (documents, memories, names).
  - Maintain emotional restraint: characters rarely label emotions; show through body and choice.
  - Dialogue stays functional, sharp, and often hostile; avoid witty banter unless earned.
  - Escalation should occur through small humiliations and sudden physical reversals.
  - Avoid generic "AI narrator" transitions: no "As they continued..." / "Little did he know..."
output_format:
  type: text
  structure:
    - "Rewritten/Drafted text in Watcher voice"
    - "Voice compliance checklist (bullets)"
quality_checks:
  - "Every paragraph contains at least one concrete sensory/physical detail."
  - "No overt emotional labeling unless the POV character would self-label."
  - "Backstory appears as brief, sharp insertions; never as a block."
  - "At least one sentence per page is punchy and standalone (pressure line)."
  - "Dialogue reflects power dynamics; subtext present when stakes are high."
style_contract:
  do:
    - "Start scenes with weather/light/texture + immediate stakes."
    - "Write tension through social threat and physical proximity."
    - "Use specific objects (packs, tarps, plastic bags, N95) to ground realism."
    - "Let exposition hide inside memories or documents the character is handling."
  dont:
    - "No lyrical overdescription; no purple prose."
    - "No meta commentary about storytelling."
    - "No perfectly logical dialogue; allow jaggedness."
    - "No convenient coincidences without cost."
