  Create a tension map for the chapter: rises, spikes, reliefs, and a final twist/hook.
inputs:
  required:
    - chapter_promise_output
    - approximate_word_count
  optional:
    - number_of_scenes: 3-7
steps:
  - Divide chapter into 3-7 segments (scenes or beats).
  - Assign each segment a tension rating 1-10.
  - Ensure at least 1 mid-chapter spike and 1 late spike.
  - Insert one relief pocket (quiet) that increases dread rather than removing it.
  - Define the final hook: question, reveal, or threat that forces next chapter.
output_format:
  type: markdown
  structure:
    - "## Tension Map"
    - "Beat/Scene list with tension scores"
    - "Relief pocket description"
    - "Final hook"
quality_checks:
  - "Tension rises overall; relief pockets are strategic."
  - "At least one escalation comes from a human choice, not coincidence."
