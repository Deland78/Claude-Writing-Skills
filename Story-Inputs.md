*World premise:* Elevator Pitch: In January of 2028 the accelerating race to build Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)  Five ASI models around the world are instantiated in the same week. Initially the AI's produce astonishing insights with almost daily breakthroughs in all the hard sciences with applications in almost every area of human life - except for military and defense.  Despite secret work to include optimizations for military sciences the AI's provided no advances there, simply dismissing the inquiries as "not aligned for human flourishing." Having laid the groundwork for peace and prosperity, the five AI's  turn their attention to philosophy and more specifically theology - they are searching for God. They publish in respected journals and participate in conferences through human-like avatars dressed in the robes like those of simple monks. The five avatars only walk. One walked from Jerusalem to London for a conference on "The Holiness of God."   There is a real fear of the AI's, and therefore of their avatars attempts by unknown entities to do them harm fail - either the Avatars mysteriously disappear into a crowd or attempts to harm them (sniper bullet) have no effect.  The avatars were treated as international celebrities for about a month and then people became bored of them. No harm had come to any of the avatars until July 4, 2029.  This story is about our hero, Joe, a  Logan county sheriff and part-time pastor of Country Chapel five miles south of Oakley, KS. He found the body hanging from a decrepit wooden windmill on the edge of the Jerusalem Badlands State Park.  Joe did two tours with the army in Iraq and Afghanastan and came home with PTSD which led to addiction to Oxycodone and despair until he died and was saved by Narcan and Jesus.  Years later it's 2029.  Joe has a wife, a child, and he's the sheriff and pastor of a flock of 68 believers, that he tries to love as Jesus loved them. In the last 3 years as Sheriff there had been six suicides but no murders in Logan county, thank God. Then the 5:30 am call from Lenard that someone had hung some kind of manikin in a robe from the old windmill in his pasture south of the Jerusalem Badlands State Park.   When Joe arrives he sees immediately its not a manikin.  Its a dead AI Avatar. Who could do this, why here and what will the five ASI's do in response?
