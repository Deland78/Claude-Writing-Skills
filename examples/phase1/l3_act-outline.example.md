# Act 1 Outline: The Dead Zone Signal

## Act Overview
Act 1 establishes Marcus's controlled isolation, introduces the disruptive signal, and forces his commitment to the journey. By the act's end, Marcus has crossed the Corridor border into hostile territory with an uneasy ally he doesn't trust. The act's dramatic function is to establish the status quo, shatter it, and make the journey inevitable.

## Chapter List

### Chapter 1: The Corridor
- **Beat Intent**: Establish Marcus's routine, competence, and isolation. Show the world through his daily trade run.
- **Value Shift**: Safety → unease (signal arrives)
- **Causal Dependency**: None (opening chapter)
- **Key Characters**: Marcus, background traders
- **Brief Summary**: Marcus completes a medical trade along the Eastern Corridor. His routine is precise, controlled, lonely. At day's end, his salvaged radio picks up a coded signal using his old unit's encryption — a frequency that shouldn't exist anymore.

### Chapter 2: Ghost Frequency
- **Beat Intent**: Marcus investigates the signal. Internal conflict: curiosity vs. self-preservation.
- **Value Shift**: Unease → dread (signal is real and targeted)
- **Causal Dependency**: Signal received in Ch 1
- **Key Characters**: Marcus
- **Brief Summary**: Marcus decodes enough of the signal to recognize his CO's cipher pattern. The signal contains coordinates inside Zone 3. Marcus decides to ignore it. Then it transmits his old callsign.

### Chapter 3: The Burned Map
- **Beat Intent**: Marcus discovers physical evidence that forces his hand — the signal connects to something his CO entrusted to him before dying.
- **Value Shift**: Dread → obligation
- **Causal Dependency**: Signal decoded in Ch 2
- **Key Characters**: Marcus
- **Brief Summary**: Marcus unearths a sealed packet his CO gave him fifteen years ago — coordinates that match the signal. Whatever the CO died protecting, someone has activated it. Marcus can't ignore a dead man's trust.

### Chapter 4: The Corridor Border
- **Beat Intent**: Marcus prepares to cross into Zone 3. Meets Elena at the border crossing.
- **Value Shift**: Obligation → reluctant partnership
- **Causal Dependency**: Decision to go in Ch 3
- **Key Characters**: Marcus, Elena
- **Brief Summary**: Marcus trades for Zone 3 intel at the border market. Elena Vasquez approaches — she has a map of the inner zone and needs a medic. Marcus doesn't trust her but can't cross alone. They negotiate terms: she guides, he patches wounds, no questions about motives.

### Chapter 5: First Night
- **Beat Intent**: Test the Marcus-Elena dynamic under pressure. First real obstacle.
- **Value Shift**: Reluctant partnership → tested trust
- **Causal Dependency**: Alliance formed in Ch 4
- **Key Characters**: Marcus, Elena
- **Brief Summary**: Their first night in Zone 3's outer ring. Faction scouts pass close. Elena's knowledge of patrol patterns saves them. Marcus notices she knows too much about faction operations. Trust frays but holds — for now.

## Continuity Touchpoints
- Marcus's prosthetic left hand — introduced Ch 1, functional but a limitation
- The CO's cipher pattern — established Ch 2, must remain consistent
- The sealed packet — physical MacGuffin introduced Ch 3, coordinates must match signal
- Elena's Zone 3 knowledge — established Ch 4-5, must be explained later (Act 2B reveal)
- Faction patrol patterns — established Ch 5, constrain movement in Act 2A

## Open Questions
- How many chapters before Marcus commits to the journey? (Currently Ch 3 — is that too fast?)
- Should there be a secondary character at the Corridor border who warns Marcus?
- Does Elena reveal anything about herself in Act 1, or is she entirely opaque?
