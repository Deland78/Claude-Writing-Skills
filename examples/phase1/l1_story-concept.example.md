# Story Concept: The Dead Zone Signal

## Premise
Fifteen years after cascading infrastructure collapse reduced civilization to scattered enclaves, ex-military medic Marcus Reeves has built a quiet life trading salvaged medical supplies along the Eastern Corridor. When a coded radio signal — using his old unit's encryption — begins broadcasting from Zone 3, a territory he barely survived, Marcus must decide whether to cross hostile ground to find out who's transmitting and why. The signal carries coordinates to something his commanding officer died to protect, and every faction on the Corridor wants it.

## Genre
- **Primary Genre**: Post-apocalyptic thriller
- **Secondary Genre(s)**: Literary fiction, survival drama

## Controlling Idea
Trust is rebuilt when a person chooses vulnerability over self-preservation, even when betrayal is the rational expectation.

## Central Dramatic Question
Will Marcus risk the fragile safety he's constructed to answer a signal from a past he's spent fifteen years running from?

## Stakes
Marcus's life, the lives of the people who depend on his medical trade, and the secret his dead CO entrusted to him — a secret that could either reunite the fractured enclaves or arm the most dangerous faction on the Corridor.

## Story Promise
This is a survival thriller about a man forced back into the world he escaped. It promises tension, moral complexity, and the cost of trust in a world where betrayal is currency. The opening establishes Marcus as competent but haunted, the signal as irresistible, and the journey as almost certainly fatal. The story will deliver on whether the thing worth finding is worth what it costs to get there.
