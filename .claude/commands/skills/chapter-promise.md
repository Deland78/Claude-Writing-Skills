# Chapter Promise Skill

Define the chapter's narrative promise and deliverable change: what shifts, what question is raised, what tension escalates, and what payoff arrives.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:chapter-promise {story_context} {chapter_number}
```

## Process

### Inputs
- **Required**: `story_context`, `chapter_number`
- **Optional**: `pov_character`, `prior_chapter_summary`, `next_chapter_target`

### Steps
1. Identify the chapter's START state (emotional + situational).
2. Identify the chapter's END state (what changed, what worsened, what new truth appears).
3. Write the central dramatic question (CDQ) in one sentence.
4. Define 2-3 escalating pressures (social, physical, moral, informational).
5. Define the payoff beat (reveal, reversal, decision, arrival, loss).
6. Produce a one-paragraph chapter promise statement.

## Output Format
## Chapter Promise
- Start State:
- End State:
- Central Dramatic Question:
- Escalating Pressures:
- Payoff Beat:
- Promise Statement (1 paragraph):

## Quality Checks
- End state is meaningfully different from start state.
- CDQ is answerable by the chapter end OR deliberately sharpened.
- Pressures escalate (not repetitive).
