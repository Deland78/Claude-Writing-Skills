# Dialogue Subtext Skill

Rewrite dialogue to carry power, misalignment, and subtext; reduce exposition and remove 'on-the-nose' emotional labeling.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:dialogue-subtext {chapter_draft}
```

## Process

### Inputs
- **Required**: `chapter_draft`

### Steps
1. Identify dialogue lines that state exactly what is meant.
2. Replace direct statements with: deflection, control attempts, threat, bargaining, sarcasm, silence, mishearing.
3. Ensure each dialogue exchange has an agenda imbalance.
4. Add micro-interruptions (body movement, environment intrusion).

## Output Format
- Revised chapter draft (dialogue improved)
- Dialogue notes (bullets)

## Quality Checks
- No conversation exists only to inform the reader.
- At least one line per major exchange carries double meaning.
