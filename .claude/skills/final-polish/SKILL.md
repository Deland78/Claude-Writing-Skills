# Final Polish Skill

Final editorial pass for Watcher voice: strengthen openings/exits, tighten scene transitions, ensure pacing and tension are sharp.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:final-polish {chapter_draft}
```

## Process

### Inputs
- **Required**: `chapter_draft`
- **Optional**: `voice_anchor` (default: "watcher_voice_anchor")

### Steps
1. Strengthen the first paragraph: sensory hook + immediate stakes.
2. Ensure every scene transition is motivated (cause -> next effect).
3. Add or sharpen 1-2 'pressure lines' that punctuate dread.
4. Remove any remaining exposition blocks.
5. Ensure ending hook is sharp and unavoidable.

## Output Format
- Final polished chapter
- Open/Close evaluation (bullets)

## Quality Checks
- Opening hooks within first 2-3 lines.
- Ending creates forward pull.
- No soft wrap-up unless intentionally bleak.
