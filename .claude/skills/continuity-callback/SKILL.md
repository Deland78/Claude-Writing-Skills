# Continuity & Callback Skill

Validate continuity (facts, timeline, knowledge states) and add purposeful callbacks/foreshadowing consistent with the book bible.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:continuity-callback {chapter_draft} {book_bible_or_notes}
```

## Process

### Inputs
- **Required**: `chapter_draft`, `book_bible_or_notes`, `scene_tracker`
- **Optional**: `prior_chapters_summary`

### Steps
1. Verify timeline, injuries, weather, distances, and character knowledge.
2. Flag contradictions or unclear cause-effect chains.
3. Add 1-2 subtle callbacks to earlier motifs/objects.
4. Add 1 foreshadow beat consistent with the chapter promise.
5. Update scene_tracker with any knowledge/object/relationship changes from this chapter.

## Output Format
## Continuity Checks
- Flags (must fix)
- Suggested callbacks
- Revised passage inserts

## Quality Checks
- No character knows what they haven't learned.
- Foreshadowing is subtle and grounded, not prophecy-like.
