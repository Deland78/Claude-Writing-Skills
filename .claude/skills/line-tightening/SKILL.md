# Line Tightening Skill

Compress prose 10-20% while preserving Watcher voice: remove redundancy, sharpen verbs, improve rhythm, and increase specificity.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:line-tightening {chapter_draft}
```

## Process

### Inputs
- **Required**: `chapter_draft`
- **Optional**: `compression_target` (10|15|20)

### Steps
1. Remove redundant modifiers, repeated observations, filler transitions.
2. Replace weak verbs with strong, specific verbs.
3. Tighten sentence openings to reduce repetition.
4. Maintain a rhythm mix: short pressure lines + occasional longer flow.

## Output Format
- Tightened chapter draft
- Compression notes (bullets)

## Quality Checks
- Meaning is preserved; clarity improved.
- No voice flattening into generic minimalism.
