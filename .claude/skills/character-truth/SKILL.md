# Character Truth Skill

Ensure each major character's actions in the chapter reflect their beliefs, fears, contradictions, and coping strategies.

## Usage
```
/project:skills:character-truth {chapter_draft} {character_list}
```

## Process

### Inputs
- **Required**: `chapter_draft`, `character_list`
- **Optional**: `character_profiles`

### Steps
1. For each major character, identify: desire, fear, lie they tell themselves, protection, weakness.
2. Scan the chapter for any action/dialogue that contradicts the truth.
3. Rewrite moments to restore psychological credibility.
4. Add at least one moment where the character reveals truth indirectly (gesture, avoidance, impulse, mistake).

## Output Format
## Character Truth Audit
- Character-by-character notes
- Patched passages (before/after optional)

## Quality Checks
- No character behaves only to serve plot.
- At least one contradiction is acknowledged or exploited.
