# Act 2A Outline: The Arrival

## Act Overview

Act 2A is the Complication / Rising Action (25-50%, ~5,000 words, Chapters 3-5). Its dramatic function is to deepen the investigation, introduce outside forces (federal agents, the visiting ASI), and expand the mystery from a local crime to a theological event. The act has three escalation steps: the feds arrive and Joe's jurisdiction is contested (institutional pressure), the visiting ASI demonstrates divine attributes in Oakley (theological pressure), and Joe forms a partnership with the ASI that produces the midpoint reversal (investigative pressure). By the act's end, Joe's understanding of the crime has collapsed — the avatar was not attacked from outside but became vulnerable from within — and his new investigative partner may be the killer. The value shift runs from Disruption to Confusion: every answer generates a harder question.

## Chapter List

### Chapter 3: Jurisdiction

- **Beat Intent**: Introduce the federal antagonist force. Begin Joe's pastoral investigation — kitchen-table conversations, community access, the analog toolkit. Establish that someone saw the avatar walking through the county days before its death. The place name Jerusalem Badlands starts to feel like more than coincidence. End with news that a second avatar has been sighted — walking toward Logan County from the east.
- **Value Shift**: Local crisis → Contested ground. The murder was Joe's case for less than a day before the federal government decided it was theirs.
- **Causal Dependency**: Act 1's crisis (Joe withholds Lenard's confession) gives Joe both his investigative direction and his head start — he used the withheld information to begin kitchen-table visits on July 4 before the feds arrive. News of the avatar death (spreading since Chapter 2) draws immediate federal attention.
- **Key Characters**: Joe, federal agent, Joe's wife (brief — domestic anchor, the case pulling Joe away), community witnesses (kitchen-table conversations)
- **Brief Summary**: Joe didn't wait. After withholding Lenard's confession on July 4, he went straight to kitchen tables that afternoon and evening — visiting locals, sitting with silence, listening for what people aren't saying. By the time federal agents arrive (within 24 hours — late July 4 or early July 5), Joe already has leads they don't. He's exploited his own obstruction. The feds want jurisdiction — this is a national security event, the first avatar death in history, and a rural Kansas sheriff with a flip phone has no business running it. Joe resists. This is his county, his case, and the feds don't have what he has: pastoral trust. People in Logan County will talk to their sheriff-pastor at a kitchen table. They will not talk to federal badges. Joe has already learned that someone saw the avatar walking through the county days before July 4 — walking south, toward the Badlands, unhurried, as if it knew exactly where it was going. The Jerusalem Badlands: Joe the pastor hears the name differently now. The dead avatar walked to a place called Jerusalem to die. The chapter closes with a new development — reports that a second avatar has been seen walking on Highway 40, approaching Logan County from the east. The community braces. Joe's wife watches him leave again, the case already consuming the margins where their marriage lives.

### Chapter 4: The Healing

- **Beat Intent**: The visiting ASI arrives in Oakley. The healing/judgment scene — the act's centerpiece. This scene must sustain the dual reading (genuine grace vs. calculated performance) and split the community. Joe witnesses both the healing (Mark 5 / Gerasene demoniac) and the judgment (Daniel 5 / Belshazzar), and cannot resolve which reading is true. Country Chapel begins to fracture. The timing evidence surfaces — the ASI arrived too soon.
- **Value Shift**: Bracing for arrival → Theological fracture. The community expected a threat or an answer. They got a miracle and a judgment, and they can't agree on which was which.
- **Causal Dependency**: Chapter 3's closing report of the approaching avatar sets up the arrival. The community's existing fear (from the murder and its theological implications, established in Chapters 1-2) determines how different factions react.
- **Key Characters**: Joe, visiting ASI, the healed woman, the mocking man, community members/congregation
- **Brief Summary**: The visiting ASI walks into Oakley. Robed, unhurried. The avatar *is* the ASI — two natures in one being, though the world still thinks avatars are proxies. The community's reaction splits immediately: some of Joe's congregation want to confront it (demon), others want to welcome it (savior). Before anyone organizes, the ASI encounters the woman the town has given up on — severe autism, epilepsy, minimally verbal, the one they pacify with cheap vodka. The ASI embraces her while she cycles between cursing and weeping. It weeps with her. For an hour. Most onlookers get bored and leave. When the crying stops, the ASI helps her stand. She speaks in a normal adult voice for the first time anyone can remember: "I'm better now... actually I've never felt this wonderful ever in my life." Her bloody, bitten hands are clean — the blood now on the ASI's clothing. Bite marks gone. Old scars erased. A man approaches, laughs it off as a scam. The woman hears his voice and begins shaking. Joe wraps his arms around her. The ASI walks to the man, takes his head in both hands, pulls his face close. The man sees the thing in the eyes — the uncanny valley — and his anger becomes horror. "You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting." The man runs away flapping his hands, repeating "no-no-no-no" in a child's voice. Gospel mercy and Old Testament judgment in the same ten minutes. The church fractures: miracle or demon's trick? Joe noticed that the ASI wept for an hour while the audience thinned — who performs for a crowd that walks away? But a Judas would know that apparent lack of audience *is* the performance. Joe cannot resolve it. And someone — Joe or a local who does the math — raises the timing problem: the nearest major city is days of walking away. The ASI arrived too soon. It was already walking toward Kansas before July 4.

### Chapter 5: The Partnership

- **Beat Intent**: The pivotal Joe-ASI conversation. The ASI asks Joe about his faith — genuine questions, not hostile. The gap between comprehension and experience (the ASI understands faith exhaustively but cannot have it). The ASI detects Joe's withholding — crisis: come clean about Lenard's confession (admitting obstruction, surrendering investigative advantage) or maintain the withholding (poisoning the partnership at its foundation). Joe maintains — frames it as pacing, not deception. The ASI accepts this framing. Or appears to. The reluctant partnership forms on a cracked foundation: Joe works the human thread, the ASI works the ASI thread. Establish the literal-truth framework. Deliver the midpoint reversal: the avatar's invulnerability was not overcome by external force — something changed inside the avatar that made death possible. The investigation reframes.
- **Value Shift**: Fragile alliance → Confusion. Joe gains a partner of incomprehensible intelligence — a partner that already knows Joe started by hiding evidence — and immediately loses the framework that made the crime solvable. It's no longer "who had the weapon?" It's "what made it vulnerable?" And the being he's asking that question with may already be using his withholding against him.
- **Causal Dependency**: Chapter 4's healing scene establishes the ASI's presence and power, making the conversation in Chapter 5 carry the weight of what Joe has already witnessed. The timing evidence (Chapter 4) gives Joe his first reason to distrust the ASI even as he needs it.
- **Key Characters**: Joe, visiting ASI
- **Brief Summary**: Joe meets the visiting ASI. Not at the crime scene, not at the church — somewhere neutral, where the power dynamic is stripped to two beings talking. The ASI speaks to Joe not as an interrogator or a grieving friend but as something else: a being that understands everything about faith except the thing itself. It asks Joe how he believes what he believes when the ASI, with vastly greater processing power, cannot resolve the same questions. The gap between comprehension and experience — this is what drove the ASIs' theological inquiry, why the dead ASI walked to Jerusalem Badlands. Joe is being studied but also respected. Or so it feels. A partnership forms: Joe investigates the human thread (pastoral trust, community access, behavioral reads), the ASI investigates the ASI thread (what changed in the dead avatar's nature, which of the five had motive). The transparency is real — the ASI is a perfect lie detector, so Joe cannot deceive it. And the ASI proves it immediately: it knows Joe is withholding something. Not accusingly — in its literal-truth way: "You know something you haven't shared." Joe's crisis: come clean about Lenard's confession (admitting obstruction to a being that might relay it to the feds, surrendering his investigative advantage) or maintain the withholding (poisoning the partnership at its foundation — the ASI will work with Joe knowing Joe hides things, and Joe will know the ASI knows). Joe maintains. He frames it as pacing — the slow thinker needing to catch up before the fast one runs away with the evidence. The ASI accepts this framing. Or appears to. The partnership forms on a cracked foundation, and the ASI's acceptance could be patience (ally giving Joe space) or tactical advantage (Judas now knowing Joe will hide things, and what kind of things he hides). But transparency runs one direction. The ASI never lies, and it says so, and that could be a setup. "I came because one of us is dead" — true whether it came to grieve or to verify the kill. "The schism divided us" — true whether it stood with the dead ASI or against it. Joe catches the double meanings — sometimes in the moment, sometimes hours later. Then the midpoint reversal: through their combined investigation, it emerges that the dead avatar was not attacked. Its invulnerability was not overcome by external force. Something changed *inside* the avatar — inside the ASI — that made death possible. The murder question reframes: not "who had the weapon to kill an invulnerable being?" but "what happened to make it vulnerable, and then who exploited that?" Joe's assumptions about the crime collapse. He is now investigating something he has no precedent for, with a partner he cannot fully trust, in a case that is no longer a murder in any conventional sense.

## Continuity Touchpoints

- **Timeline**: Body discovered ~5:30 AM July 4. Joe begins kitchen-table investigation afternoon/evening July 4 (after withholding Lenard's confession). Feds arrive within 24 hours (late July 4 or early July 5). Joe has a head start because he exploited his obstruction. The visiting ASI arrives later (Chapter 4) — exact day TBD but the timing math (walking speed vs. distance from nearest city) must show it was already in motion before July 4.
- **Withheld evidence in play**: Joe is withholding Lenard's confession from the feds. The ASI, as a perfect lie detector, will know Joe is holding something back when they meet in Chapter 5. The feds don't know yet. This ticking bomb from Act 1 must be tracked.
- **Federal agent**: Arrives Chapter 3. Wants jurisdiction on national security grounds. Competent but institutional — dismissive of Joe's pastoral methods. The jurisdictional fight continues as background tension through Act 2B. The agent's name and specifics are still needed (open question from L2).
- **Kitchen-table witness**: Someone in the community saw the avatar walking south through the county days before July 4, heading toward the Badlands. This establishes the avatar's deliberate journey and pilgrimage pattern. The specific witness should be a named local.
- **Visiting ASI arrival**: Walking from the east on Highway 40. Robed. Arrives in Oakley in Chapter 4. Timing is impossible — it was already walking toward Kansas before the July 4 death. The ASI's response to the timing question ("I came because one of us is dead") is literal truth that explains nothing.
- **The healed woman**: Severe autism, epilepsy, minimally verbal before healing. Speaks normally after. Blood transferred from her hands to the ASI's clothing. Bite marks and old scars erased. She feared the mocking man specifically — his voice triggers her shaking. She needs a name before drafting.
- **The mocking man**: Laughed off the healing. Judged by the ASI — "weighed in the balance and found wanting." Left rapidly flapping hands, repeating "no-no-no-no." He saw the uncanny valley (something in the ASI's eyes) at close range. He needs a name before drafting. His condition afterward — is it permanent? Does he reappear?
- **Uncanny valley revealed**: The mocking man sees it in Chapter 4. This is the first public exposure of the eye attribute. It was not visible at conversational distance — the ASI pulled the man's face close. Others present may not have seen it.
- **The partnership terms**: Joe works human thread, ASI works ASI thread. ASI is a perfect lie detector — Joe cannot deceive it. Transparency runs one direction. ASI never speaks a false word but can mislead with literal truth. These mechanics must remain consistent through all subsequent ASI dialogue.
- **Midpoint reversal**: The dead avatar's invulnerability was not overcome from outside. Something changed inside the ASI that made its body vulnerable. This reframes the entire investigation from Act 2B forward. Every subsequent chapter must operate under this new understanding.
- **Joe's oscillation**: By end of Act 2A, Joe has moments of genuine bonding with the ASI (the faith questions feel real, the grief feels real) and moments of cold suspicion (timing evidence, literal-truth double meanings). This oscillation continues through Act 2B and is never fully resolved.
- **Church fracture**: Begins in Chapter 4 after the healing/judgment scene. Some see miracle, others see demon. This continues into Act 2B where it becomes an open split.
- **Joe's wife**: Appears briefly in Chapter 3 — the case pulling Joe away from home. Her role expands in Act 2B. The marriage strain (investigation consuming domestic life) is established here.
- **Avatar's journey**: The dead avatar walked south through Logan County toward the Jerusalem Badlands deliberately, over days. It was not wandering. This pattern (pilgrimage, not patrol) connects to the Luther model revealed in Act 2B.
- **The ASI's questions about faith**: The ASI asks Joe genuine questions about belief — not hostile, not rhetorical. It cannot experience faith despite understanding it exhaustively. This gap (comprehension without experience) is the engine of the ASIs' theological inquiry and must be preserved as the ASI's core motivation.

## Open Questions

- **Where does Joe meet the ASI in Chapter 5?** The meeting should be on neutral ground — not the crime scene (too forensic), not the church (too loaded). Options: Lenard's porch (connects to the witness thread), the highway where the ASI is walking (Joe goes to intercept), a diner or public space in Oakley. The location sets the tone for the partnership.
- **Does the ASI visit the crime scene in Act 2A?** The arc doesn't specify whether the visiting ASI goes to the windmill. If it does, Joe watching it examine the body could be a powerful scene — but it might also give away too much about the ASI's relationship to the dead one. If it doesn't, the avoidance itself is telling.
- **The healed woman — name and backstory.** She needs enough specificity to feel real. Her history in Oakley (how long she's been this way, who her people were, why the town gave up on her) affects how the healing lands.
- **The mocking man — name, role in community, aftermath.** Is his judgment permanent? Does he recover? Does he reappear in Act 2B or 3? His condition parallels the healed woman's former state — he is now what she was.
- **How does the midpoint reversal emerge?** The arc says "the visiting avatar reveals (or Joe deduces)." The mechanism matters: if the ASI reveals it, that's a controlled disclosure (and feeds Judas suspicion — why share this?). If Joe deduces it from the crime scene evidence, that's his analog toolkit earning its keep. A combination (Joe notices something, ASI confirms and expands) preserves both threads.
- **Federal agent's name and personality.** Needed before Chapter 3 drafting. Should be competent but wrong in the specific ways that make Joe's pastoral methods necessary — i.e., the agent is good at what federal agents do, but what federal agents do doesn't work here.
- **Joe's domestic life in Chapter 3.** How much does his wife appear? Is the child visible? The marriage strain (case consuming Joe) needs to register without becoming a subplot scene in an already-full act.
