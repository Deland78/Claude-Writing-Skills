# Act 1 Outline: The Body in Jerusalem

## Act Overview

Act 1 is the Beginning Hook (0-25%, ~5,000 words, Chapters 1-2). Its dramatic function is to establish Joe's world as already fracturing, discover the impossible corpse, and set the external clock. The reader bonds with Joe's competence at a crime scene — where Joe's own dual reading (sheriff sees forensics, pastor sees theology) reframes the investigation: the avatar came here on its own, to a place called Jerusalem, and arranged itself like a statement. Then competence shatters against Joe's PTSD rage (the Thomas Covenant moment — punching Brian). The act's crisis is a Best Bad Choice born from Joe's two identities in direct conflict: Lenard, whose anti-ASI hatred is public knowledge and whose son LJ has possible HFF connections, begs Joe to keep LJ's name out of the investigation — "He didn't do this. Don't let him be disappeared. He's all I've got left." The sheriff should report a potential suspect with ties to a militant group near a dead avatar. The pastor should protect a bereaved father's last remaining family. Joe the pastor wins. He enters Act 2A compromised — hiding not forensic evidence but a potential suspect, hours after assaulting a civilian, with the feds incoming and a perfect lie-detector ASI on the way.

## Chapter List

### Chapter 1: The Windmill

- **Beat Intent**: Discover the body. Establish Joe's dual identity (sheriff who reads crime scenes, pastor who reads symbols). Reveal the cracks in Joe's life through internal voice. Joe's own crime scene analysis provides the investigation's first reframe: no footprints, no struggle, hands unbound and positioned — the avatar came here on its own. Avatars walk everywhere; nobody carried this body here. Joe the pastor sees what Joe the sheriff can't: a crucifixion tableau in a place called Jerusalem. And a complication: the body is on Lenard's land. Joe knows Lenard's public anti-ASI hatred (the Hungry Farmer diner rants), suspects Lenard's son LJ has HFF connections, and knows LJ and his friends likely vandalized the wind farm. A dead avatar on Lenard's property is not a coincidence Joe can ignore.
- **Value Shift**: Routine → Shattered certainty. Joe expected vandalism or a prank call from Lenard. He found an impossible corpse arranged like a statement in a place called Jerusalem.
- **Causal Dependency**: None (inciting incident).
- **Key Characters**: Joe, Lenard
- **Brief Summary**: At 5:30 AM on July 4, 2029, Joe takes Lenard's call — something hanging from the old windmill in his south pasture, near the Jerusalem Badlands. Joe drives out expecting vandalism. What he finds is an ASI avatar in a monk's robe, hanging from a rotted wooden structure, face peaceful, hands unbound and positioned with deliberate care. Joe the pastor sees the crucifixion tableau before Joe the sheriff processes the physical evidence. He secures the scene with combat-trained precision — but the scene is wrong. No footprints in the hardpan except Lenard's truck. No sign of struggle. The avatar came here on its own — avatars walk everywhere, nobody carried this body, and the evidence confirms it. This looks like a display. Or an offering. Joe the pastor hears the place name differently: the dead avatar walked to a place called Jerusalem. During the drive and at the scene, Joe's internal voice reveals a man already buckling — and an escalation pattern the reader needs to see: his rare anger used to be self-directed ("Stupid, Stupid, Stupid"), but last month he snapped at his best friend, and last week he turned on his wife ("NOW YOU ARE AGAINST ME. YOU DON'T WANT ME AS AN ENEMY"), slamming the front door so hard the house shook. The trajectory is unmistakable: self → friend → wife → and the reader doesn't know yet what's next. He fears CTE from Iraq concussions. He refuses to carry any weapon (people think it's pastoral conviction — it's terror of what he'd do). And there are the Oxycodone pills he found in a traffic stop last week, enough to charge the woman as a dealer, enough to pull him off the wagon if he believed it would help him get through this. His pastorate is slipping, his badge is under pressure, and the man his wife fell in love with — the man she watched change in Salina, the man she said "no" to for months until she saw the change hold — is being replaced by someone she thought was buried at his baptism. And there's a complication the reader sees Joe register: this is Lenard's land. Lenard, whose hatred of the ASIs is public knowledge — ranting at the Hungry Farmer diner about how the ASIs want to reduce human population, how they control the weather, how they're demons. Lenard, who stopped coming to Country Chapel after his wife died of cancer two years ago and blamed the ASIs for her death. Lenard, whose son LJ runs with boys Joe suspects vandalized the wind farm (the boys believe it powers ASI data centers). Joe has suspected LJ and his friends are wannabe HFF — Human Freedom Fighters. And now there's a dead avatar on Lenard's property. The first murder in Logan County in three years, and it's the first avatar death in history. Joe calls it in knowing his world just changed, knowing he was already failing before it did, and knowing that the property owner is a man he's pastored, grieved with, and now has to consider as a suspect.

### Chapter 2: The Crater

- **Beat Intent**: Introduce Joe's faith statement and immediately undermine it with his own action. Establish Joe's PTSD rage as an active, witnessed danger (not backstory). Show the community's first reaction to news of the death. Then the Lenard scene — Joe goes to Lenard as both sheriff (Lenard is a suspect) and pastor (Lenard is a bereaved congregant who stopped coming to church). Lenard's plea: LJ didn't do this, don't let the feds disappear him, he's all I've got left. Joe confirms the wind farm vandalism. The crisis: the sheriff should report a potential suspect with HFF-adjacent connections near a dead avatar; the pastor should protect a grieving father's last remaining family. Joe the pastor wins. He enters Act 2A hiding a potential suspect.
- **Value Shift**: Barely holding on → Overwhelmed and compromised. Joe's assault on Brian destroys the credibility he needs for both roles. His decision to protect LJ makes him complicit — a sheriff who assaulted a civilian and is now shielding a potential suspect from federal investigators.
- **Causal Dependency**: Chapter 1's crime scene discovery (on Lenard's land, with Lenard as a suspect) triggers Joe's visit to Lenard. News spreading draws Brian into Joe's path for the rage episode.
- **Key Characters**: Joe, Brian (Joe's wife's twin brother — the family black sheep, a bully who has always known how to push people to the edge and over it; Joe has practiced "love your enemies" with Brian specifically for years), Joe's wife (her reaction carries the weight of watching her husband punch her twin brother — she fears for Joe, not of him; she fears the old man buried by baptism is coming back), Lenard, LJ (mentioned — Lenard's son, wannabe HFF, wind farm vandal)
- **Brief Summary**: Chapter 2 opens with Joe's faith statement surfacing — through sermon preparation for a July 4 service he'll never deliver, or prayer, or conversation with his wife: "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice." The statement is alive in Joe's mind as he returns to town. Then it's tested immediately. News of the avatar's death has spread through Oakley by mid-morning. Brian — Joe's wife's twin brother, the family black sheep, a bully who has always known how to push people to the edge and over it — finds him. Brian says the wrong thing the way he always says the wrong thing, except today is the worst day of Joe's life. Joe has practiced "love your enemies" with Brian for years — let insults bounce off, turned the other cheek through mockery, absorbed the disrespect, treated the commandment as a discipline. That discipline *is* Joe's faith statement in action: persevering through Brian's abuse is suffering, and the years of turning the other cheek is sacrifice. "Grace given to persevere" — and today the perseverance breaks. The escalation pattern completes: self → friend → wife → Brian. Joe's combat-mode PTSD surges. Not a flashback — the threat-assessment circuits lighting up, the body moving before the mind intervenes. Joe punches Brian. Breaks his nose. Witnesses see everything. As sheriff: Joe just assaulted a civilian who posed no threat. As pastor: he just destroyed his longest, hardest practice of the commandment he took most seriously — love your enemies. And he did it to his wife's twin. The shame is total. Joe's wife's reaction is not surprise but recognition — and her fear is not of Joe but *for* Joe. She knows what he was before God changed him: the fights and arrests in Salina, the man she thought was buried by baptism. She saw the change long before Joe ever asked her out. She said "no" for months, watching him closely, until she finally said yes. She'd never had reason to fear him until last week, when he'd yelled "NOW YOU ARE AGAINST ME. YOU DON'T WANT ME AS AN ENEMY" and slammed the door so hard the house shook. That wasn't the man she married. That was the man she thought was dead. If this anger is possible, then the drugs and alcohol are possible too — and there's a bag of Oxycodone pills from last week's traffic stop, more than enough to pull him off the wagon. Now he's punched her twin brother and broken his nose. Brian has always known how to push people over the edge — she punched him once herself, freshman year at Oakley High — but she's a more mature Christian now, and Joe had never raised his voice at Brian. Insults bounced off Joe. Until they didn't. She is afraid for Joe. This is the crater. This is why he carries no gun. And the faith statement he just formulated — "grace given to persevere" — enters the story already disproven against himself. When the ASI asks Joe about his faith in Act 2A, the reader knows Joe's claim has already failed its first test. The statement is not an abstraction Joe carries into the investigation. It's a wound. Later — Joe goes to Lenard's ranch. He goes as both sheriff and pastor, and the two roles are already at war. Lenard is a suspect: public anti-ASI hatred, conspiracy theories at the Hungry Farmer diner, a son with suspected HFF connections, and a dead avatar on his property. But Lenard is also a man Joe pastored through his wife's cancer and death, a man who stopped coming to Country Chapel when his wife died and blamed the ASIs for her death. Joe finds Lenard afraid — not for himself. For LJ. Lenard tells Joe he found the body exactly as he said and knew immediately there'd be a shitstorm. Then the plea: "He didn't do this. Don't let him be disappeared. He's all I've got left." Joe asks: "What about vandalizing the windmills?" A long pause. Lenard nods. "But he was pulled into that by his no-account friends. He didn't do this — don't let him be disappeared, he's all I've got left." The crisis: the feds are coming. A sheriff should report a potential suspect whose son has HFF-adjacent connections and confirmed vandalism near a dead avatar. But a pastor just heard a bereaved father beg him to protect his last remaining family from disappearing into a federal black site. Joe the sheriff should report LJ. Joe the pastor can't. The two identities collide, and the pastor wins. Joe withholds — not forensic evidence, but a potential suspect. If the feds find out, Joe is finished: assault plus shielding a suspect. If the visiting ASI (a perfect lie detector) detects this, Joe is hiding someone who might have killed one of its kind. Act 1 closes with Joe overwhelmed and compromised — a man who just chose to protect a grieving father's son over his duty as an officer, carrying a secret that could destroy him, shame he can't hide, and an investigation that his own crime scene analysis has already reframed into something he has no framework for.

## Continuity Touchpoints

- **Brian (brother-in-law)**: Joe's wife's twin brother. Family black sheep. Bully who has always known how to push people to the edge and over. Joe practiced "love your enemies" with Brian for years — insults bounced off. Until July 4. Joe punched Brian, broke his nose. Brian's face is what Joe sees when the ASI names his crisis in Act 2B. Brian reappears in later chapters; his fear of Joe (a bully who discovered what it feels like) becomes a thread. Joe's wife punched Brian once herself — freshman year at Oakley High.
- **Joe's escalation pattern**: Self-directed anger ("Stupid, Stupid, Stupid") → snapped at best friend (last month) → outburst at wife ("NOW YOU ARE AGAINST ME. YOU DON'T WANT ME AS AN ENEMY," door slammed, last week) → punched Brian (July 4). This trajectory must be referenced and tracked — it's the evidence that the old Joe is resurfacing.
- **Oxycodone — live temptation**: Joe found a bag of Oxycodone pills in a traffic stop last week. More than enough to charge the woman as a dealer. More than enough to pull Joe off the wagon. These pills are a specific, physical temptation — not background craving. The wife knows about them and fears what could happen. This thread surfaces as active threat in Act 2B.
- **Lenard**: Former regular at Country Chapel. Wife died of cancer two years ago — Lenard blames the ASIs, says they want to reduce human population. Stopped attending church. Anti-ASI views are public knowledge (Hungry Farmer diner). Is a suspect by proximity and motive. NOT actually HFF, but afraid for his son. Found the body, called Joe, told the truth about finding it. His plea is about LJ, not himself.
- **LJ (Lenard Junior)**: Lenard's son. Wannabe HFF (not official member). Responsible with friends for vandalizing a wind farm in the county (the boys believe it powers ASI data centers). Joe suspected LJ's involvement but had no evidence until Lenard confirmed it (the nod). LJ is now a person of interest near a dead avatar — not because he did it (Lenard insists he didn't), but because his HFF connections and the vandalism make him a target for federal disappearance.
- **HFF (Human Freedom Fighters)**: A militant anti-ASI group. LJ and friends are wannabe members, not official. The feds would treat any HFF connection near a dead avatar as a national security threat. The wind farm vandalism is the confirmed connection.
- **Hungry Farmer diner**: Local gathering place for farmers. Where Lenard has publicly ranted about ASIs. This is where his anti-ASI views became common knowledge.
- **Withheld suspect**: Joe chose to protect LJ from the incoming feds. This is far more dangerous than hiding forensic evidence — Joe is shielding a potential suspect with HFF-adjacent connections. If the feds find out: assault + shielding a suspect = Joe is finished. If the visiting ASI (perfect lie detector) detects this: Joe is hiding someone who might have killed one of its kind. This ticking bomb must be tracked through Acts 2A and 2B.
- **Crime scene details**: Hands unbound and positioned deliberately. No footprints except Lenard's truck. Face peaceful. Monk's robe. Hanging from a rotted wooden windmill. These physical details must remain consistent in all subsequent references.
- **Time of death**: July 4, 2029, discovered at approximately 5:30-6:00 AM. The avatar was seen walking to the windmill the night of July 3. The window between arrival and death is overnight — hours, not days.
- **Joe's faith statement**: Introduced in Act 1 (through sermon prep, prayer, or conversation with wife): "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice." Must be the exact formulation used in all subsequent tests.
- **Joe's weapon refusal**: Joe carries no gun, taser, or any weapon. The stated reason (pastoral conviction) vs. real reason (fear of CTE/rage) is established here. No scene should contradict this.
- **Joe's sobriety**: Years clean from Oxycodone. The craving is no longer just background — there are actual pills from last week's traffic stop. The wife fears the drugs are next in the escalation pattern. Surfaces as active threat in Act 2B.
- **Joe's wife**: Brian's twin sister. Saw Joe change in Salina before he ever asked her out. Said "no" for months, watched him closely, finally said yes. Never had reason to fear him until last week's outburst. Her fear is for Joe (the old man returning) not of Joe. She's a more mature Christian now. Name still needed.
- **Joe's pre-conversion history**: Fights and arrests in Salina. The man buried by baptism. His wife saw the change. The community knows the old Joe existed. This history is what makes the escalation pattern terrifying — not just that Joe is angry, but that the anger has a precedent the baptism was supposed to have ended.
- **Logan County stats**: Six suicides, zero murders in three years under Joe's watch. The avatar death is the first murder.
- **External clock**: By end of Act 1, the question "what will the five ASIs do?" is live. No ASI has arrived yet. The visiting ASI arrives in Act 2A.
- **Jerusalem Badlands**: The place name carries theological weight. Joe (the pastor) recognizes this. The name should feel like more than coincidence to the reader without the narrative insisting on it.
- **The windmill**: Old, rotted, wooden. On Lenard's south pasture, adjacent to the Jerusalem Badlands. A specific physical structure that will be referenced in flashbacks and investigation returns.

## Open Questions

- **Brian — occupation and role in Oakley.** Named. Joe's wife's twin brother. Family black sheep, bully. What does Brian do in Oakley? Is he a congregant (attending out of family obligation) or does he refuse to attend Country Chapel? Does he have a family of his own?
- **How does Joe's faith statement surface in Act 1?** Resolved: surfaces early in Chapter 2, before the rage episode — through sermon prep, prayer, or conversation with his wife. The statement is alive in Joe's mind when the brother-in-law triggers the rage, making the episode an immediate failure of the thing Joe just claimed. Specific vehicle (sermon prep vs. prayer vs. conversation) still open for drafting — sermon prep has the strongest dramatic irony.
- **Joe's wife — name.** Brian's twin sister. Key details now established: saw Joe change in Salina, said "no" for months before saying yes, fears for Joe (not of him), punched Brian herself once (freshman year). Still needs a name.
- **Joe's child — age, gender, presence in Act 1.** The child is mentioned in the arc as someone Joe protects. Does the child appear in Act 1 or only become present later?
- **How fast does news spread?** Rural Kansas, July 4 holiday. Does Joe have deputies? Does he call the state bureau of investigation? Does he try to contain the information? The speed of news spreading determines the pace of Chapter 2.
- **Did LJ actually do it?** Lenard insists he didn't. Joe doesn't know. The arc leaves the murder mechanism open (another ASI directly, ASI betrayal to humans, independent human discovery). If LJ and his HFF-wannabe friends are the human actors, the thematic weight shifts — the murder was done by frightened boys, not a calculated conspiracy. If LJ is innocent, Joe's protection of him is vindicated but the real killer is elsewhere.
- **LJ — age, specifics, does he appear on page in Act 1?** Or is he only present through Lenard's plea? If he appears, Joe's sheriff instincts would read him (behavioral tells). If he doesn't, Joe is protecting someone he hasn't assessed.
- **The avatar's hands — positioned how?** "Deliberately" is established, but the specific positioning matters for the crucifixion parallel and for later scene returns. Open palms (surrender/offering)? Folded (prayer)? The position should carry theological meaning that Joe reads as a pastor.
