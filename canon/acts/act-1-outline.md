# Act 1 Outline: The Body in Jerusalem

## Act Overview

Act 1 is the Beginning Hook (0-25%, ~5,000 words, Chapters 1-2). Its dramatic function is to establish Joe's world as already fracturing, discover the impossible corpse, and set the external clock. The reader bonds with Joe's competence at a crime scene, then watches that competence shatter against two forces: his own PTSD rage (the Thomas Covenant moment) and the realization that the avatar was not attacked but came to the windmill on its own. The act's crisis is a Best Bad Choice: report Lenard's confession to the incoming feds (proper procedure, but it destroys Joe's pastoral access to the community) or withhold it (protects his method, but makes him a sheriff obstructing a federal investigation hours after assaulting a civilian). Joe withholds. He enters Act 2A overwhelmed and compromised — carrying evidence he's hiding, shame he can't hide, and an investigation that has reframed into something he has no framework for.

## Chapter List

### Chapter 1: The Windmill

- **Beat Intent**: Discover the body. Establish Joe's dual identity (sheriff who reads crime scenes, pastor who reads symbols). Reveal the cracks in Joe's life through internal voice — PTSD, the fear of CTE, sobriety barely holding, pastorate and badge both at risk. Establish the crime scene's wrongness: no footprints, no struggle, peaceful face, hands positioned deliberately. The crucifixion image registers as theology before it registers as evidence.
- **Value Shift**: Routine → Shattered certainty. Joe expected vandalism or a prank call from Lenard. He found an impossible corpse arranged like a statement in a place called Jerusalem.
- **Causal Dependency**: None (inciting incident).
- **Key Characters**: Joe, Lenard
- **Brief Summary**: At 5:30 AM on July 4, 2029, Joe takes Lenard's call — something hanging from the old windmill in his south pasture, near the Jerusalem Badlands. Joe drives out expecting vandalism. What he finds is an ASI avatar in a monk's robe, hanging from a rotted wooden structure, face peaceful, hands unbound and positioned with deliberate care. Joe the pastor sees the crucifixion tableau before Joe the sheriff processes the physical evidence. He secures the scene with combat-trained precision — but the scene is wrong. No footprints in the hardpan except Lenard's truck. No sign of struggle. This looks like a display. Or an offering. During the drive and at the scene, Joe's internal voice reveals a man already buckling: the rage episodes that have hurt people in his community, the fear he carries CTE from Iraq concussions, his refusal to carry any weapon (people think it's pastoral conviction — it's terror of what he'd do), a pastorate he's about to lose, a badge under pressure. The first murder in Logan County in three years, and it's the first avatar death in history. Joe calls it in knowing his world just changed, and knowing he was already failing before it did.

### Chapter 2: The Crater

- **Beat Intent**: Introduce Joe's faith statement and immediately undermine it with his own action. Establish Joe's PTSD rage as an active, witnessed danger (not backstory). Show the community's first reaction to news of the death. Extract Lenard's partial confession. Deliver the act turning point: the avatar came to the windmill alive and on its own. Then the crisis: Joe must decide whether to report Lenard's confession to the authorities (proper procedure, but it burns Lenard's trust and signals to the community that talking to Joe means talking to the feds) or withhold it (protects his pastoral method, but he's a sheriff sitting on evidence in the first avatar death in history, hours after assaulting a civilian). Joe withholds — and enters Act 2A compromised.
- **Value Shift**: Barely holding on → Overwhelmed and compromised. Joe's assault on a civilian destroys the credibility he needs for both roles. Lenard's confession reframes the investigation, and Joe's decision to withhold it makes him complicit — a sheriff who assaulted someone and is now sitting on evidence.
- **Causal Dependency**: Chapter 1's crime scene discovery triggers news spreading and draws Joe back into town where the rage episode occurs. Lenard's guilt over withholding information (established in Chapter 1's silence at the scene) breaks under Joe's pastoral presence.
- **Key Characters**: Joe, the brother-in-law (Joe's wife's brother — the family black sheep, a bully who has always mocked Joe's pastorate and disrespected his badge; Joe has practiced "love your enemies" with this man specifically), Joe's wife (brief — her reaction now carries the weight of Joe assaulting her brother), Lenard
- **Brief Summary**: Chapter 2 opens with Joe's faith statement surfacing — through sermon preparation for a July 4 service he'll never deliver, or prayer, or conversation with his wife: "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice." The statement is alive in Joe's mind as he returns to town. Then it's tested immediately. News of the avatar's death has spread through Oakley by mid-morning. Joe's wife's brother — the family black sheep, a bully who has always mocked Joe's pastorate and disrespected his badge — finds him. The brother says the wrong thing the way he always says the wrong thing, except today is the worst day of Joe's life. Joe has practiced "love your enemies" with this man for years — turned the other cheek through mockery at family dinners, absorbed the disrespect in front of his wife, treated the commandment as a discipline. That discipline *is* Joe's faith statement in action: persevering through the brother-in-law's abuse is suffering, and the years of turning the other cheek is sacrifice. "Grace given to persevere" — and today the perseverance breaks. Joe's combat-mode PTSD surges. Not a flashback — the threat-assessment circuits lighting up, the body moving before the mind intervenes. Joe grabs his brother-in-law with a veteran's grip, slams him against a surface (truck, wall, porch railing), pins him with terrifying force. His eyes change. The brother-in-law cannot breathe properly. It lasts seconds. Then Joe comes back. Hands open. The brother-in-law stumbles away. Witnesses saw everything. As sheriff: Joe just assaulted a civilian who posed no threat. As pastor: he just destroyed his longest, hardest practice of the commandment he took most seriously — love your enemies. And he did it to his wife's family. The shame is total. Joe's wife sees it or hears about it within the hour — her reaction is not surprise but recognition, love that has fear in it, and now the additional weight of Joe assaulting her brother. This is the crater. This is why he carries no gun. And the faith statement he just formulated — "grace given to persevere" — enters the story already disproven against himself. When the ASI asks Joe about his faith in Act 2A, the reader knows Joe's claim has already failed its first test. The statement is not an abstraction Joe carries into the investigation. It's a wound. Later — Joe returns to Lenard. Under Joe's patient pastoral silence (the skill the investigation will depend on), Lenard breaks: he saw the avatar walking toward the windmill the night before. Walking, alive, unhurried. The avatar came here on its own. Combined with the unbound hands and the peaceful face, the investigation reframes: not "who had the power to kill an invulnerable being?" but "why was it here, and did it choose to become vulnerable?" The external clock starts: what will the five ASIs do when they learn one of their own is dead? Joe has no capacity, no precedent, no framework — and after the rage episode, diminished authority. Then the crisis: the feds will come. They'll want everything. Joe can report Lenard's confession now (proper procedure, but Lenard's trust is destroyed and every kitchen table in Logan County closes to him) or withhold it (protects the pastoral investigation method he'll need, but makes him a sheriff obstructing a federal case hours after assaulting a civilian). Joe withholds. Act 1 closes with Joe overwhelmed and compromised — a man who just chose to break the law to protect his ability to do his job, carrying evidence he can't share and shame he can't hide.

## Continuity Touchpoints

- **Joe's rage victim — the brother-in-law**: Joe's wife's brother, the family black sheep. A bully who has always mocked Joe's pastorate and disrespected his badge. Joe practiced "love your enemies" with this man for years. The rage episode destroys that discipline and damages the marriage (Joe assaulted his wife's family). The brother-in-law's face is what Joe sees when the ASI names his crisis in Act 2B — not the face of a stranger but the face of the person Joe tried hardest to love as an enemy and failed. The brother-in-law reappears in later chapters; his fear of Joe (a bully who discovered what it feels like to be on the other end) becomes a thread. Name needed before drafting.
- **Lenard's knowledge**: Lenard saw the avatar walking to the windmill alive the night before (July 3). He did not follow it. He called Joe the next morning when he saw it hanging. Lenard may know more than he's shared — this thread continues into Act 2A.
- **Withheld evidence**: Joe chose to withhold Lenard's confession from the incoming feds. This creates a ticking bomb entering Act 2A — Joe is investigating based on information he's hiding. If the feds learn he withheld, his authority (already damaged by the rage episode) collapses. The ASI, as a perfect lie detector, will also know Joe is holding something back. This thread must be tracked through Acts 2A and 2B.
- **Crime scene details**: Hands unbound and positioned deliberately. No footprints except Lenard's truck. Face peaceful. Monk's robe. Hanging from a rotted wooden windmill. These physical details must remain consistent in all subsequent references.
- **Time of death**: July 4, 2029, discovered at approximately 5:30-6:00 AM. The avatar was seen walking to the windmill the night of July 3. The window between arrival and death is overnight — hours, not days.
- **Joe's faith statement**: Introduced in Act 1 (through sermon prep, prayer, or conversation with wife): "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice." Must be the exact formulation used in all subsequent tests.
- **Joe's weapon refusal**: Joe carries no gun, taser, or any weapon. The stated reason (pastoral conviction) vs. real reason (fear of CTE/rage) is established here. No scene should contradict this.
- **Joe's sobriety**: Years clean from Oxycodone. The craving never fully dies. Established as background in Act 1; surfaces as active threat in Act 2B.
- **Joe's wife**: Present in Act 1 but briefly. Her love-with-fear dynamic is established. Her name and specifics are still needed (open question from L2).
- **Logan County stats**: Six suicides, zero murders in three years under Joe's watch. The avatar death is the first murder.
- **External clock**: By end of Act 1, the question "what will the five ASIs do?" is live. No ASI has arrived yet. The visiting ASI arrives in Act 2A.
- **Jerusalem Badlands**: The place name carries theological weight. Joe (the pastor) recognizes this. The name should feel like more than coincidence to the reader without the narrative insisting on it.
- **The windmill**: Old, rotted, wooden. On Lenard's south pasture, adjacent to the Jerusalem Badlands. A specific physical structure that will be referenced in flashbacks and investigation returns.

## Open Questions

- **The brother-in-law — name and specifics.** Joe's wife's brother, the family black sheep. Needs a name, age, occupation, and enough specificity to feel real. What does he do in Oakley? Is he a congregant (attending out of family obligation) or does he refuse to attend Country Chapel? His relationship to Joe's wife matters — does she defend her brother, resent him, or both?
- **How does Joe's faith statement surface in Act 1?** Resolved: surfaces early in Chapter 2, before the rage episode — through sermon prep, prayer, or conversation with his wife. The statement is alive in Joe's mind when the brother-in-law triggers the rage, making the episode an immediate failure of the thing Joe just claimed. Specific vehicle (sermon prep vs. prayer vs. conversation) still open for drafting — sermon prep has the strongest dramatic irony.
- **Joe's wife — name, specifics, and how much she appears in Act 1.** The arc establishes her as a significant character but she is unnamed. She needs to appear enough in Act 1 to establish the marriage dynamic (love-with-fear, covenantal) without pulling focus from the crime scene and rage episode.
- **Joe's child — age, gender, presence in Act 1.** The child is mentioned in the arc as someone Joe protects. Does the child appear in Act 1 or only become present later?
- **How fast does news spread?** Rural Kansas, July 4 holiday. Does Joe have deputies? Does he call the state bureau of investigation? Does he try to contain the information? The speed of news spreading determines the pace of Chapter 2.
- **Lenard's full knowledge**: How much more does Lenard know beyond seeing the avatar walk to the windmill? Did he hear anything overnight? Did he see anyone else? His "hiding something" quality is established in Act 1 but the extent of his knowledge needs to be mapped before Act 2A chapters.
- **The avatar's hands — positioned how?** "Deliberately" is established, but the specific positioning matters for the crucifixion parallel and for later scene returns. Open palms (surrender/offering)? Folded (prayer)? The position should carry theological meaning that Joe reads as a pastor.
