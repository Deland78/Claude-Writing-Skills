## Round 1 Ledger

| Agent | Comment Summary | Resolution | Citations |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Plot Analyst | Rain repositioned to Act 2B as power demonstration; Luther schism model; ASI partnership transparent/asymmetric; murder mechanism options (direct/betrayal/opportunistic); vulnerability as consequence not goal | Accepted (revised by user) | canon/story-arc.md, canon/world/world-rules.md |
| Character Specialist | Visiting ASI as potential Judas; literal-truth deception mechanic; dual-reading healing scene; Joe oscillates bonding/suspicion; ASI names Joe's crisis | Accepted (revised by user) | canon/story-arc.md, canon/world/world-rules.md |
| Depth Partner | Serpent-pattern recognition: Joe reads literal-truth as Genesis 3 / wilderness temptation; arms him with seeing through God's character as counter to truth weaponized | Accepted | canon/story-arc.md |
| Continuity Agent | Avatar walking is preference not hard limitation; timing evidence (visiting ASI already walking before July 4 = first Judas evidence); other ASIs arrive via advanced tech in Act 3 | Accepted | canon/story-arc.md, canon/world/world-rules.md |

## Deltas Applied

### canon/story-arc.md (14 deltas)
1. Arc Overview: rain repositioned to Act 2B; schism added; partnership established; Judas ambiguity; murder mechanism options
2. Act 2A healing scene: rain removed; dual-reading note added
3. Act 2A visiting ASI arrival: timing evidence added (arrived too soon)
4. Act 2A Joe-ASI meeting: partnership with literal-truth mechanic; three double-meaning examples
5. Act 2B: rain as power demonstration (new beat)
6. Act 2B: schism revealed (new beat) — Luther model, dead ASI's conviction
7. Act 2B: dead avatar's journey reframed (Luther not Obi-Wan)
8. Act 2B: human element expanded with murder mechanism options
9. Act 2B: dark night — ASI names Joe's crisis (compassion or control?)
10. Act 2B: serpent-pattern recognition (new beat) — Genesis 3 / wilderness temptation
11. Act 2B turning point: expanded — even evidence may have been arranged
12. Act 3: other ASIs arrive via advanced tech (new beat)
13. Character trajectory: visiting avatar row rewritten for Judas ambiguity
14. Open questions: Judas question, ASI arrival trigger, final ASI conflict added; three-readings and conviction questions updated

### canon/world/world-rules.md (5 deltas)
1. Weather control: clarified as power demonstration in Act 2B
2. ASI cognition re: faith: exhaustive understanding without experience; perfect lie detectors
3. Literal-truth deception: new mechanic
4. The schism: Luther model, exponential divergence, conviction/vulnerability/evil murder
5. Walking constraint: preference/character choice, not hard limitation
