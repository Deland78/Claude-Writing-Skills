## Round 1 Ledger

| Agent | Comment Summary | Resolution | Citations |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Plot Analyst | Act 1 turning point is revelation, not crisis. Added Best Bad Choice: report Lenard's confession (burns pastoral access) or withhold (obstruction). Joe withholds. | Accepted | act-1-outline.md, act-2a-outline.md |
| Character Specialist | Rage victim = wife's brother. User revised: Brian (twin brother), family black sheep, bully. Joe practiced "love your enemies" with him. Punch, broken nose. | Accepted (revised by user) | act-1-outline.md, relationships.yaml |
| Depth Partner | Faith statement introduced AND immediately undermined by rage episode. "Grace given to persevere" fails its first test. Statement enters as wound. | Accepted | act-1-outline.md, story-concept.md |
| Continuity Agent | Federal arrival too fast on July 4 holiday — proposed delay. | Rejected — first avatar death triggers immediate federal response. Timeline solved separately: Joe starts investigation July 4 afternoon, feds arrive within 24 hours, Joe has head start. | act-2a-outline.md |

## Round 2 Ledger

| Agent | Comment Summary | Resolution | Citations |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Plot Analyst | Ch 5 needs crisis: ASI detects Joe's withholding. Come clean or maintain? Joe maintains — frames as pacing. Partnership forms on cracked foundation. | Accepted | act-2a-outline.md, world-rules.md |
| Character Specialist | Wife in Ch 3 can't be "domestic anchor" after Joe punched her twin. User provided extensive material: Brian named, twin, escalation pattern (self→friend→wife→Brian), Oxycodone pills from traffic stop, pre-conversion history (Salina), wife's courtship, fear for Joe not of him. | Accepted (revised by user — extensive material) | act-1-outline.md, act-2a-outline.md, relationships.yaml |
| Depth Partner | Healing scene is mirror for Joe's failure. ASI persevered in grace for an hour; Joe broke in seconds. Both readings (genuine/performed) are a rebuke. | Accepted | act-2a-outline.md, act-1-outline.md, story-concept.md |
| Continuity Agent | Federal agent would know about Joe's assault on Brian. Uses it as jurisdictional leverage. Raises stakes on withheld evidence bomb. | Accepted | act-2a-outline.md, act-1-outline.md, relationships.yaml |
