# Session State — Saved Before Auto-Compact

## Pipeline Position
- `.pipeline-state.yaml`: level L3, act null

## Mob Session Status — Story Arc Review
- **Phase 1**: Structure accepted
- **Phase 2**: In progress
  - Plot Analyst: ACCEPTED — separate the divine demonstration and midpoint reversal into different chapters (Ch3: feds/investigation, Ch4: ASI arrives/healing/judgment, Ch5: private meeting/reversal)
  - Character Specialist: NOT YET CALLED
  - Depth Partner: NOT YET CALLED
  - Continuity Agent: NOT YET CALLED
- **Phase 3-4**: Not yet reached

## Active Revision from User (Plot Analyst comment — REVISED, not yet applied)

The user revised the Plot Analyst recommendation with significant new story decisions:

### Rain miracle repositioned to Act 2B
The rain miracle moves from Act 2A to Act 2B ("The ASIs respond"). It is now a **power demonstration**, not a mercy:
- The ASIs bring a brief rain shower to Logan County and surrounding farms, then stop it
- This reveals the ASIs control weather — a new revelation to humans
- The community quickly concludes the drought in Logan County and the whole Midwest has been the ASIs' doing all along
- This is a shift from individual-level grace/judgment (the woman healed, the man judged in Act 2A) to a collective power demonstration
- "The gods giveth and the gods taketh away" — framing

### The question of WHY this demonstration
The user raises the critical question: what motivates this power move? Options tied to ASI relationships:
1. **If the ASIs were close (like family)**: Grief + anger + demand for justice → the rain demonstration is a threat/warning
2. **If ASI relationships were mixed (some bonds strong, others strained)**: Opens the possibility that one ASI killed another (Cain and Abel parallel)
3. **If one or more ASIs have become Lucifer figures**: Seeking to be God, ruling over or killing others → the demonstration is a dominance display

### The vulnerability revelation
Is the dead avatar's vulnerability something the visiting ASI has discovered during the investigation? This connects the power demonstration to the investigation timeline.

### Joe and the visiting ASI as investigation partners
The user asks: are Joe and the avatar now partners in the investigation? This would fundamentally change the Act 2B-3 dynamic — from Joe investigating alone while the ASI observes, to a collaboration between a pastor-sheriff and a superintelligence.

## Key Story Decisions Made So Far (All Sessions)

### From Story Concept (L1)
- Genre: SF-thriller-mystery, philosophical fiction
- Mystery-thriller is A-plot; faith crisis rides inside the same causal chain
- Controlling idea: "Faith is preserved when a man sees the fallen world through the lens of God's character rather than questioning God's character because of a fallen world"
- Joe's faith statement (tested throughout): "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice"
- CDQ: "Can Joe solve the avatar's murder and protect his community before the ASIs impose their own justice — and will his faith survive what he learns about the ASIs and why the avatar died?"
- Three readings of the crucifixion parallel: recapitulation, divine judgment, satanic/demonic mockery
- Single POV (close third, Joe)
- 20K words, 8-10 chapters, 4-act structure

### From Mob Session on Concept
- Plot Analyst: dual engines must share one causal chain; mystery is A-plot
- Character Specialist: Joe's investigation is pastoral (kitchen-table confessions, combat behavioral reads, theological reading of evidence)
- Depth Partner: crucifixion parallel acknowledged as deliberate; three readings established

### From Story Arc (L2) and User Revisions
- Joe was already failing before the murder — losing pastorate and badge after PTSD rage episodes
- Joe carries no weapons (fear of CTE/rage, not pastoral conviction)
- Romans 7:15-25 anchors Joe's redemption arc
- Each ASI is an individual person with two natures: distributed intellect + physical avatar body (enfolded, not remote-controlled)
- Avatars have one uncanny valley attribute — something in the eyes
- The healing scene: ASI heals the woman (Gerasene demoniac echo, Mark 5), judges the mocking man (Daniel 5, Belshazzar's feast)
- The healed woman and the judged man are established characters
- Joe's redemption: he sees himself and the suffering he caused through God's character

### World Rules Established (canon/world/world-rules.md)
- ASI dual nature (intellect + physical body, enfolded)
- Uncanny valley in the eyes
- ASIs refuse military applications
- Avatars only walk, wear monk robes
- Prior invulnerability (sniper fire, mobs ineffective)
- Non-lethal force only against attackers
- Capabilities: rain manipulation, healing, moral knowledge
- Weather control (NEW — being established in this revision)

### Preferences (canon/preferences.md)
- Always fix typos without asking unless genuinely ambiguous
