# Session State — Saved Before /clear

## Pipeline Position
- `.pipeline-state.yaml`: level L3, act null
- Completed: L1 story concept, L2 story arc
- Current: Mob session on story arc, Phase 3 COMPLETE (parked), Phase 4 next

## Mob Session Status — Story Arc Review
- **Phase 1**: Structure accepted
- **Phase 2**: COMPLETE — all four agents commented
  - Plot Analyst: ACCEPTED (revised by user) — rain to Act 2B as power demonstration; Luther schism model; ASI partnership (transparent, asymmetric in access); murder mechanism options (direct/betrayal/opportunistic); vulnerability as consequence not goal
  - Character Specialist: ACCEPTED (revised by user) — visiting ASI as potential Judas; literal-truth deception mechanic; dual-reading healing scene; Joe oscillates bonding/suspicion; ASI names Joe's crisis (option 1)
  - Depth Partner: ACCEPTED — serpent-pattern recognition: Joe reads literal-truth mechanic as Genesis 3 / wilderness temptation; arms him with seeing through God's character as the only counter to truth weaponized
  - Continuity Agent: ACCEPTED — avatar walking is preference not hard limitation; timing evidence (visiting ASI already walking toward Kansas before July 4 = first Judas evidence); other ASIs arrive via advanced tech in Act 3 final conflict
- **Phase 3**: COMPLETE — Resolution Check done. All 4 agents accepted, no vetoes, no conflicts. 14 deltas to story-arc.md, 5 to world-rules.md. User chose: PARK.
- **Phase 4**: NOT YET STARTED — Commit (write canon, update relationships, advance state, output trace). Canon files already have deltas applied; Phase 4 = finalize trace, update relationships, advance pipeline state.

## All Deltas Applied to Canon Files (This Mob Session)

### canon/story-arc.md
1. Arc Overview: rain repositioned to Act 2B; schism (Luther model) added; partnership established; Judas ambiguity added; murder mechanism options
2. Act 2A healing scene: rain removed; dual-reading note added (genuine grace vs. calculated performance)
3. Act 2A visiting ASI arrival: timing evidence added (arrived too soon, was already walking before July 4)
4. Act 2A Joe-ASI meeting: partnership with literal-truth mechanic; transparency runs one direction; three examples of double-meaning statements; Judas suspicion
5. Act 2B: rain as power demonstration (new beat); schism revealed (new beat); dead avatar's journey reframed (Luther not Obi-Wan); human element expanded with murder mechanism options
6. Act 2B dark night: ASI names Joe's crisis with clinical precision (compassion or control?)
7. Act 2B: serpent-pattern recognition (new beat) — Joe recognizes literal-truth as Genesis 3 / wilderness temptation
8. Act 2B turning point: expanded — even evidence may have been arranged by visiting ASI
9. Act 3: other ASIs arrive via advanced tech (new beat) — shatters walking perception, final escalation
10. Act 3 meaning confrontation: updated for arriving ASIs and escalation
11. Act 3 departure: rewritten — visiting avatar walks (the old way), others leave by other means
12. Character trajectory: visiting avatar row rewritten for sustained Judas ambiguity
13. Thematic pressure points: Act 2A, 2B, Act 3 all updated
14. Open questions: added Judas question, ASI arrival trigger, final conflict between ASIs; updated three-readings question with Judas intersection; updated dead ASI's conviction and schism questions

### canon/world/world-rules.md
1. Weather control: clarified as power demonstration in Act 2B
2. ASI cognition re: faith: exhaustive understanding without experience; perfect lie detectors
3. Literal-truth deception: new mechanic — never lies but can mislead with true statements
4. The schism: Luther model, exponential divergence, conviction → vulnerability → evil murder
5. Walking constraint: changed from hard limitation to preference/character choice; public believes it's all they can do

## Key Story Decisions Made So Far (All Sessions)

### From Story Concept (L1)
- Genre: SF-thriller-mystery, philosophical fiction
- Mystery-thriller is A-plot; faith crisis rides inside the same causal chain
- Controlling idea: "Faith is preserved when a man sees the fallen world through the lens of God's character rather than questioning God's character because of a fallen world"
- Joe's faith statement (tested throughout): "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice"
- CDQ: "Can Joe solve the avatar's murder and protect his community before the ASIs impose their own justice — and will his faith survive what he learns about the ASIs and why the avatar died?"
- Three readings of the crucifixion parallel: recapitulation, divine judgment, satanic/demonic mockery
- Single POV (close third, Joe)
- 20K words, 8-10 chapters, 4-act structure

### From Mob Session on Concept
- Plot Analyst: dual engines must share one causal chain; mystery is A-plot
- Character Specialist: Joe's investigation is pastoral (kitchen-table confessions, combat behavioral reads, theological reading of evidence)
- Depth Partner: crucifixion parallel acknowledged as deliberate; three readings established

### From Story Arc (L2) and Mob Session on Arc
- Joe was already failing before the murder — losing pastorate and badge after PTSD rage episodes
- Joe carries no weapons (fear of CTE/rage, not pastoral conviction)
- Romans 7:15-25 anchors Joe's redemption arc
- Each ASI is an individual person with two natures: distributed intellect + physical avatar body (enfolded, not remote-controlled)
- Avatars have one uncanny valley attribute — something in the eyes
- The healing scene: ASI heals the woman (Gerasene demoniac echo, Mark 5), judges the mocking man (Daniel 5, Belshazzar's feast) — must sustain dual reading (genuine grace or Judas performance)
- Joe's redemption: he sees himself and the suffering he caused through God's character
- ASI schism: Luther/Diet of Worms model. Dead ASI held conviction it could not recant. Vulnerability was consequence of conviction, not sought. Murder was evil.
- Visiting ASI as potential Judas: every action sustains two readings (ally or betrayer). Literal-truth deception mechanic — never lies but can mislead.
- Joe-ASI partnership: transparent (ASI is perfect lie detector), asymmetric in access not information. Joe oscillates between bonding and suspicion.
- Rain miracle: Act 2B power demonstration, not mercy. "The gods giveth and the gods taketh away." Follows ASI's discovery of vulnerability mechanism.
- Timing evidence: visiting ASI was already walking toward Kansas before July 4 — first Judas evidence.
- Serpent-pattern recognition: Joe reads literal-truth mechanic as Genesis 3 / wilderness temptation. Only counter is seeing through God's character.
- Avatar walking: preference/character choice, not hard limitation. Other ASIs arrive via advanced tech in Act 3 (shatters perception).
- Murder mechanism options: another ASI directly (Cain/Abel), ASI betraying vulnerability to humans (military/nationalists), humans discovering independently.

### World Rules Established (canon/world/world-rules.md)
- ASI dual nature (intellect + physical body, enfolded)
- Uncanny valley in the eyes
- ASIs refuse military applications
- Avatars walk by preference (not limitation), wear monk robes
- Prior invulnerability (sniper fire, mobs ineffective)
- Non-lethal force only against attackers
- Weather control (power demonstration)
- Healing, moral knowledge
- ASI cognition: exhaustive intellectual understanding of faith without experiencing it
- Literal-truth deception: true statements arranged to mislead
- The schism: Luther model, exponential divergence
- Perfect lie detectors

### Preferences (canon/preferences.md)
- Always fix typos without asking unless genuinely ambiguous

## Open Questions (from story-arc.md)
1. Who is the human actor in the avatar's death? (murder mechanism: direct ASI, betrayal to humans, or independent human discovery)
2. What exactly was the dead ASI's conviction? (Luther model — what couldn't it recant?)
3. Which ASI(s) opposed the dead ASI's conviction, and how?
4. Joe's wife and child — names and specifics
5. The federal agent — name, personality
6. How does the visiting avatar communicate?
7. How does the Joe-ASI partnership break down and recover (if it does)?
8. Does Joe know who the human actor is before Act 3?
9. Is the visiting ASI a Judas? (resolve or leave ambiguous?)
10. What triggers the other ASIs' arrival in Act 3, and how many come?
11. What is the final conflict between the ASIs?
12. Which of the three readings does the story lean toward — or refuse to choose?

## Git State
- All changes committed and pushed through `a1ac380`
- Branch: main, up to date with origin
- Only untracked: `.migration-rollback.yaml`, `Talk-with-Editor.md`
- Session state updated but not yet committed

## Next Step
Resume mob session Phase 4 (Commit): finalize trace, update relationships.yaml, advance pipeline state to "L2 arc complete + reviewed." Then move to L3 act outlines (or answer open questions first if user prefers).
