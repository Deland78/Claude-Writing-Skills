# Session State — Saved 2026-02-14

## Pipeline Position
- `.pipeline-state.yaml`: level L3, act 2
- Completed: L1 story concept, L2 story arc + mob review, L3 Act 1 outline + mob review, L3 Act 2A outline + mob review, L3 Act 2B outline (generated, not mob-reviewed)
- Current: Act outlines in progress. Act 2B and Act 3 still need mob review and/or generation.

## Mob Session Status — Act 1 + Act 2A Outlines
- **Phase 1**: Structure accepted
- **Phase 2**: COMPLETE — 2 rounds, all four agents per round
- **Phase 3**: COMPLETE — committed
- **Phase 4**: COMPLETE — trace written, relationships updated, pipeline advanced

## Mob Session on L2 Arc — COMPLETE
- All 4 phases done. Trace at `canon/traces/mob-session-L2-story-arc.md`.

## All Deltas Applied to Canon Files (This Session)

### Phase 4 of L2 mob (completed this session)
- `canon/relationships.yaml`: populated with 13 entities, 16 relationships
- `.pipeline-state.yaml`: advanced to L3, canon_version 2
- Trace written to `canon/traces/mob-session-L2-story-arc.md`

### L3 Act Outlines Generated
- `canon/acts/act-1-outline.md` — 2 chapters (The Windmill, The Crater)
- `canon/acts/act-2a-outline.md` — 3 chapters (Jurisdiction, The Healing, The Partnership)
- `canon/acts/act-2b-outline.md` — 2 chapters (The Rain, The Serpent's Voice) — NOT mob-reviewed

### Mob Session on Act 1 + Act 2A (2 rounds)
Round 1:
1. Act 1: Best Bad Choice crisis added — withhold Lenard's confession or report to feds. Joe withholds.
2. Rage victim = Brian (Joe's wife's twin brother), named, family black sheep, bully, "love your enemies" target. Punch, broken nose.
3. Faith statement introduced AND immediately undermined by rage episode. Enters as wound.
4. Continuity: feds arrive fast (rejected delay proposal). Solved: Joe starts investigation July 4 afternoon, head start.

Round 2:
5. Ch 5 crisis: ASI detects Joe's withholding. Joe frames as pacing. Partnership on cracked foundation.
6. Extensive character material from user: Brian named (twin), escalation pattern (self→friend→wife→Brian), Oxycodone pills from traffic stop, pre-conversion history (Salina fights/arrests), wife's courtship (said no for months, saw the change), wife fears FOR Joe not OF him, wife punched Brian once (freshman year). Updated Act 1, Act 2A, relationships.yaml.
7. Healing scene as mirror for Joe's failure of grace — ASI persevered an hour, Joe broke in seconds.
8. Federal agent knows about Joe's assault on Brian, uses as jurisdictional leverage. Double risk: assault + obstruction.

## Key Story Decisions Made (All Sessions — Cumulative)

### From Story Concept (L1)
- Genre: SF-thriller-mystery, philosophical fiction
- Mystery-thriller is A-plot; faith crisis rides inside the same causal chain
- Controlling idea: "Faith is preserved when a man sees the fallen world through the lens of God's character rather than questioning God's character because of a fallen world"
- Joe's faith statement: "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice"
- CDQ: "Can Joe solve the avatar's murder and protect his community before the ASIs impose their own justice — and will his faith survive what he learns about the ASIs and why the avatar died?"
- Three readings of the crucifixion parallel: recapitulation, divine judgment, satanic/demonic mockery
- Single POV (close third, Joe)
- 20K words, 8-10 chapters, 4-act structure

### From Story Arc (L2) and Mob Session on Arc
- Joe was already failing before the murder — losing pastorate and badge after PTSD rage episodes
- Joe carries no weapons (fear of CTE/rage, not pastoral conviction)
- Romans 7:15-25 anchors Joe's redemption arc
- Each ASI is an individual person with two natures: distributed intellect + physical avatar body
- Avatars have one uncanny valley attribute — something in the eyes
- The healing scene: Gerasene demoniac echo (Mark 5) + Belshazzar's feast (Daniel 5) — dual reading
- ASI schism: Luther/Diet of Worms model. Dead ASI's conviction: "I will have God or nothing."
- Visiting ASI as potential Judas: literal-truth deception mechanic
- Joe-ASI partnership: transparent, asymmetric in access
- Rain miracle: Act 2B power demonstration, not mercy
- Serpent-pattern recognition: Genesis 3 / wilderness temptation
- Avatar walking: preference, not limitation. Others arrive via advanced tech in Act 3.
- Murder mechanism options: direct ASI, betrayal to humans, independent human discovery

### From Act Outlines (L3) and Mob Session
- **Brian**: Joe's wife's twin brother. Family black sheep, bully. Joe punched him, broke his nose (Act 1 Ch 2). Joe practiced "love your enemies" with him for years.
- **Joe's escalation pattern**: self-directed ("Stupid, Stupid, Stupid") → snapped at best friend (last month) → outburst at wife ("NOW YOU ARE AGAINST ME," door slammed, last week) → punched Brian (July 4)
- **Joe's pre-conversion history**: fights and arrests in Salina. The man buried by baptism.
- **Joe's wife**: Brian's twin. Saw Joe change in Salina. Said "no" for months. Fears for Joe (old man returning) not of him. More mature Christian. Punched Brian once (freshman year). Name still needed.
- **Oxycodone pills**: found in traffic stop last week. Live temptation, not just background craving.
- **Faith statement enters as wound**: introduced in Ch 2, immediately undermined by rage episode
- **Act 1 crisis**: Best Bad Choice — withhold Lenard's confession (obstruction) or report (burns pastoral access). Joe withholds.
- **Withheld evidence**: ticking bomb through Acts 2A-2B. ASI (lie detector) detects it in Ch 5. Feds don't know yet.
- **Ch 5 crisis**: ASI detects withholding. Joe frames as pacing. ASI accepts (or appears to). Partnership on cracked foundation. Enriches Judas thread.
- **Federal agent uses assault as leverage**: arrives knowing Joe punched Brian. Jurisdictional ammunition.
- **Healing scene as mirror**: Joe's private shame — ASI persevered in grace for an hour, Joe broke in seconds. Both readings (genuine/performed) are a rebuke.
- **Timeline**: body discovered ~5:30 AM July 4. Joe starts investigation July 4 afternoon. Feds arrive within 24 hours.

## Open Questions (from all outlines)
1. Who is the human actor in the avatar's death?
2. What exactly was the dead ASI's conviction? ("I will have God or nothing" — but specifics?)
3. Which ASI(s) opposed the dead ASI's conviction, and how?
4. Joe's wife — name
5. Joe's child — age, gender, presence
6. The federal agent — name, personality
7. How does the visiting avatar communicate?
8. How does the Joe-ASI partnership break down and recover?
9. Is the visiting ASI a Judas?
10. What triggers the other ASIs' arrival in Act 3?
11. What is the final conflict between the ASIs?
12. Which of the three readings does the story lean toward?
13. Brian — occupation, role in Oakley, congregant or not?
14. The healed woman — name and backstory
15. The mocking man — name, aftermath, does he reappear?
16. Where does Joe meet the ASI in Chapter 5?
17. Does the ASI visit the crime scene in Act 2A?
18. How does the midpoint reversal emerge (ASI reveals vs. Joe deduces)?
19. The avatar's hands — positioned how?

## Git State
