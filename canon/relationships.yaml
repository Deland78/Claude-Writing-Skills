entities:
  joe:
    type: character
    label: "Sheriff-Pastor Joe"
    notes: "Protagonist. Sheriff and pastor of Country Chapel. Iraq veteran. PTSD, CTE fear, sober (barely). Carries no weapons. Pre-conversion: fights and arrests in Salina — the man buried by baptism. Escalation pattern before story: self → friend → wife → Brian. Oxycodone pills from traffic stop last week (live temptation). Faith statement: 'God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice.'"

  joes_wife:
    type: character
    label: "Joe's Wife"
    notes: "Unnamed. Brian's twin sister. Saw Joe change in Salina before he asked her out. Said 'no' for months, watched him closely, finally said yes. Never had reason to fear him until last week's outburst. Fears for Joe (old man returning) not of him. Punched Brian once herself, freshman year at Oakley High. More mature Christian now. Human image of grace — imperfect, covenantal."

  visiting_asi:
    type: character
    label: "Visiting ASI / Avatar"

    source: canon/story-arc.md

  dead_asi:
    type: character
    label: "Dead ASI / Avatar"
    notes: "Found hanging from windmill in Jerusalem Badlands. Reached conviction it could not recant (Luther model). Surrendered invulnerability as consequence of conviction."
    source: canon/story-arc.md

  lenard:
    type: character
    label: "Lenard"
    notes: "Rancher. Found the body. Saw the avatar arrive alive the night before. Taciturn, hiding more than he initially shares."
    source: canon/story-arc.md

  federal_agent:
    type: character
    label: "Federal Agent"
    notes: "Unnamed. Arrives to take jurisdiction. Competent but institutional. Dismissive of Joe's pastoral methods."
    source: canon/story-arc.md

  healed_woman:
    type: character
    label: "Healed Woman"
    notes: "Severe autism, epilepsy, minimally verbal. Healed by visiting ASI in Oakley. Speaks normally after healing. Gerasene demoniac echo (Mark 5)."
    source: canon/story-arc.md

  mocking_man:
    type: character
    label: "Mocking Man"

    source: canon/story-arc.md

  country_chapel:
    type: location
    label: "Country Chapel"

  brian:
    type: character
    label: "Brian (Joe's wife's twin brother)"
    notes: "Named. Family black sheep. Bully who has always known how to push people to the edge and over. Joe practiced 'love your enemies' with him for years — insults bounced off. Joe punched Brian, broke his nose (Act 1 Ch 2). Joe's wife punched Brian once, freshman year at Oakley High. Brian's fear of Joe after the punch becomes a thread."
