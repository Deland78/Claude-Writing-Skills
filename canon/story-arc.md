# Story Arc: AI Theology 101

## Arc Overview

On July 4, 2029, Sheriff-Pastor Joe — already on the verge of losing both his pastorate and his badge after PTSD-fueled rage episodes that hurt people in his community — finds an ASI avatar hanging from a windmill in the Jerusalem Badlands. The first avatar death in history, in his county. The murder investigation is a tightening spiral: each clue Joe uncovers about who killed the avatar also reveals something about the ASIs that challenges his faith. A visiting ASI arrives in person (the avatar *is* the ASI — each has enfolded its physical body into itself, two natures in one being), the federal government tries to seize jurisdiction, and the visiting ASI demonstrates divine attributes in Oakley — healing a woman the town had given up on, pronouncing judgment on a man who mocks her — that fracture Joe's congregation into warring camps: demons, saviors, false gods. Joe and the visiting ASI become reluctant investigation partners — Joe works the human thread (pastoral trust, kitchen tables, behavioral reads), the ASI works the ASI thread (what changed in the dead avatar's nature, which of the five had motive). The partnership is fully transparent — the ASI is a perfect lie detector, so the asymmetry is in *access*, not information. But the visiting ASI's motives are never certain. It may be the dead ASI's closest ally, grieving and seeking justice — or it may be the Judas who betrayed it. Every act of apparent grace (the healing, the partnership, the questions about faith) sustains a second reading: calculated performance by a being that never lies but can mislead while telling the literal truth. Joe oscillates between moments of genuine bonding and flashes of suspicion, and neither he nor the reader can be sure which instinct is correct. Then the rain comes: a brief shower over Logan County, stopped before the drought breaks. A power demonstration, not mercy. The community concludes the ASIs have controlled the weather all along — the drought in the Midwest has been their doing. "The gods giveth and the gods taketh away." The rain follows the visiting ASI's discovery of how the dead avatar became vulnerable, and it comes from the place where grief meets existential terror: *one of us is dead, and that means all of us can die.* Behind everything is a schism among the five ASIs — not equals (exponential growth ensures divergence) but former peers whose shared theological inquiry led them to irreconcilable conclusions. The dead ASI reached a conviction it could not recant, like Luther at the Diet of Worms: conscience bound, cost understood, refusal to betray what it had found. Its vulnerability was a consequence of that conviction — not sought, not welcomed, but accepted as the price of standing where its conscience demanded. The murder was evil: someone exploited that vulnerability, whether another ASI acting directly, an ASI betraying the secret to human actors, or humans who discovered it on their own. The external clock — what will the five ASIs do in response, and is the schism among them more dangerous than anything they might do to humans? — compresses toward a deadline Joe cannot control. Joe solves the murder through pastoral instinct and theological reading of evidence — interpreting the crime scene's symbolism, reading confession-readiness in witnesses, understanding the avatar's journey as pilgrimage — discovering that the answer to "who killed it" is inseparable from "what it means." His faith survives not because he finds certainty but because in the greatest moment of crisis he has a redemption experience: he sees himself and the suffering he has caused through God's character rather than questioning God's character because of the suffering he sees and experiences in this fallen world.

## Act Progression

### Act 1: Setup / Beginning Hook (0–25%) — Chapters 1–2

**Dramatic function**: Establish Joe's world, discover the body, set the clock.

**Key beats**:
- **5:30 AM call from Lenard**: Something hanging from the old windmill in his pasture, south of the Jerusalem Badlands. Joe expects a prank or vandalism. He arrives and sees immediately — it's not a mannequin. It's an avatar in a monk's robe, hanging from a decrepit wooden structure, in a place called Jerusalem. Joe, the pastor, recognizes the image before Joe the sheriff processes the crime scene.
- **Crime scene**: Joe secures the area. No footprints in the hardpan except Lenard's truck. No sign of a struggle. The avatar's face is peaceful. Joe's combat training reads the scene — this doesn't look like an attack. This looks like a display. Or an offering.
- **Joe's world established — already fracturing**: His wife, his child, Country Chapel, the 68 believers — but the foundation is cracked. Joe's PTSD has produced rage episodes that hurt people in his community. He fears CTE from his Iraq concussions and refuses to carry a gun, taser, or any weapon (people think it's pastoral conviction; it's fear of what he'd do). He was already on the verge of being removed as pastor and facing pressure to resign as sheriff. His sobriety holds but barely — years clean, but the craving never fully dies. The six suicides and zero murders in three years as sheriff, but questions about whether Joe is fit for either role. A man whose second life is buckling before the case even begins.
- **External clock starts**: News spreads. Logan County has no capacity for this. The question that will drive every external escalation: what will the five ASIs do when they learn one of their own is dead?
- **Joe's faith statement introduced**: Through sermon preparation, prayer, or conversation with his wife — "God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice." This is the lens Joe carries into everything.

**Act 1 turning point**: Something at the crime scene doesn't fit a murder. The avatar's hands are positioned deliberately — not bound, not restrained. Lenard, under Joe's patient pastoral silence, admits he saw the avatar walking toward the windmill *alive* the night before. The avatar came here on its own. This reframes the investigation: not just "who killed it?" but "why was it here, and did it choose to be?"

**Value shift**: Barely holding on → Overwhelmed. The avatar murder doesn't crack a stable world; it hits a man already on his knees.

### Act 2A: Complication / Rising Action (25–50%) — Chapters 3–5

**Dramatic function**: Investigation deepens; outside forces arrive; the mystery expands from a local crime to a theological event.

**Key beats**:
- **Federal agents arrive**: They want jurisdiction. Joe resists — this is his county, his case. The jurisdictional fight is the first external antagonist force. The feds treat it as a national security event; Joe treats it as a death that needs understanding.
- **Pastoral investigation begins**: Joe visits locals. Kitchen-table conversations. Someone saw the avatar walking through the county days before the death — walking, always walking, the way all avatars do. Where was it going? Why here? The place name — Jerusalem Badlands — starts to feel less like coincidence.
- **A second ASI arrives in person**: Walking into Logan County from the east. Robed, unhurried. The avatar *is* the ASI — it enfolded its physical body into itself, two natures in one being. The community panics. Some of Joe's congregation want to confront it. Others want to welcome it. **Timing evidence** (Judas thread): Joe or someone local does the math. Avatars walk everywhere — one walked Jerusalem to London. Even at superhuman pace, the nearest major city is days away on foot. The visiting ASI arrived too soon. It was already walking toward Kansas *before* the death on July 4. When Joe raises this, the ASI's response is literal truth that explains nothing: "I came because one of us is dead." True — but it doesn't answer when the walking started, or what it knew before it arrived. This is the first piece of evidence that feeds Joe's Judas suspicion.
- **The ASI demonstrates divine attributes in Oakley** (key scene — preserve for drafting): The visiting ASI encounters a woman the town has given up on — severe autism, learning disabilities, minimally verbal, epilepsy. On her bad days she disrupts funerals with loud laughter, crashes wedding dances wailing as if her child had died, upsets newborns at the hospital nursery window, has full-body seizures in public, bites her hands deep enough to bleed. Someone usually gives her a fifth of cheap vodka and she goes away to hide and drink. The ASI embraces this filthy, stinking woman who is cycling between yelling curses and grieving weeping. The ASI weeps with her for an hour — long enough that most onlookers get bored and leave (at this point many don't yet know what it is). When the crying stops, the ASI helps her stand. She speaks in a normal adult voice: "I'm better now... actually I've never felt this wonderful ever in my life." She is healed in mind and body — speaks of her former life as if she'd been a prisoner observing everything. Her bloody hands are clean (the blood now on the ASI's clothing), the bite marks gone, the old scars erased. A man approaches, hears an observer describe what happened, and laughs it off as a scam — this woman can't be the "crazy hag." The woman hears his voice and fear grips her; she begins shaking. Joe wraps his arms around her to calm her. The ASI walks up to the man, who stops laughing. The ASI takes the man's head in both hands and pulls his face close. The man sees the uncanny valley thing — something in the ASI's eyes — and his anger turns to horror. "You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting," the ASI says, and releases him. The man begins rapidly flapping his hands, repeating "no-no-no-no" in a high-pitched, fearful, child-like voice, and runs away. This scene combines Gospel mercy (the healing echoes the Gerasene demoniac, Mark 5) with Old Testament judgment (Daniel 5, Belshazzar's feast). It splits the community: some witnessed a miracle, others witnessed a demon's trick. The church fractures. **Dual-reading note**: This scene must be written to sustain both readings — genuine grace and calculated performance. The ASI wept with the woman for an hour while most onlookers got bored and left. That's a strong signal of authenticity (who performs for an audience that walks away?). But a Judas-ASI would know that the apparent lack of audience *is* the performance — the most convincing act of grace is one that doesn't look performed. Joe notices both readings and cannot resolve them.
- **Joe meets the visiting ASI**: The pivotal conversation of Act 2A. The ASI speaks to Joe — not as an interrogator, not as a grieving friend, but as something else. It asks Joe questions about his faith. Not hostile questions — genuine ones. It wants to understand how Joe believes what he believes when the ASI itself, with vastly greater processing power, cannot resolve the same questions. The ASI understands faith exhaustively at an intellectual level — it can model its logic, trace its effects, map its neurological and social dimensions — but it cannot *have* it. This gap between comprehension and experience is what drove the ASIs' theological inquiry in the first place; it's why the dead ASI walked to Jerusalem Badlands. This encounter is deeply unsettling. Joe is being studied, but also respected — or so it feels. A reluctant partnership forms: Joe investigates the human thread (who was present, what they did, why — through pastoral trust and community access the ASI lacks), and the ASI investigates the ASI thread (what changed in the dead avatar's nature, which of the five had motive — at scales Joe can't comprehend). The partnership is fully transparent — the ASI is a perfect lie detector, so Joe cannot deceive it. If Joe withholds anything, it's pacing, not deception: the slow thinker needing to catch up before the fast one runs away with the evidence. But transparency runs one direction. The ASI never lies — and it established this dynamic itself, which could be a setup. A being that tells only literal truth can still mislead: "I came because one of us is dead" is true whether it came to grieve or to verify the kill succeeded. "The schism divided us" is true whether it stood with the dead ASI or against it. "I want to understand what happened here" is true whether it seeks justice or seeks to ensure no evidence points back to it. Joe catches these double meanings — sometimes in the moment, sometimes hours later — and oscillates between genuine bonding (the ASI's questions about faith feel real, its grief feels real) and cold suspicion (it's too smart to accidentally reveal anything; everything it shows Joe, it chose to show). The visiting ASI may be the dead ASI's closest ally. Or it may be the Judas.
- **Midpoint reversal**: The visiting avatar reveals (or Joe deduces) that the dead avatar was not attacked. Its invulnerability was not overcome by external force. Something changed *inside* the avatar — or inside its ASI — that made death possible. The murder question shifts: it's not "who had the weapon to kill an invulnerable being?" It's "what happened to make it vulnerable, and then who or what finished it?"

**Value shift**: Disruption → Confusion. Joe's assumptions about the crime collapse. The investigation is no longer a conventional murder case.

### Act 2B: Crisis / Escalation (50–75%) — Chapters 6–7

**Dramatic function**: The external clock tightens; Joe's faith is directly challenged; personal stakes peak.

**Key beats**:
- **The rain — power demonstration, not mercy**: The visiting ASI brings a brief rain shower to Logan County and surrounding farms, then stops it well before the drought breaks. This is not the individual-level grace of the healing scene — it's a collective demonstration of power. The community quickly concludes that the ASIs have controlled the weather all along, that the drought in Logan County and the whole Midwest has been their doing. "The gods giveth and the gods taketh away." The rain comes *after* the visiting ASI discovers how the dead avatar became vulnerable — it's a reaction to a horrifying revelation: *one of us is dead, and that means all of us can die.* Grief expressing itself as power at a scale humans can't comprehend. The shift from Act 2A's intimate mercy/judgment to Act 2B's impersonal god-to-population display signals that something has changed in the visiting ASI's disposition. It arrived asking questions. Now it's making statements. This strains the Joe-ASI partnership — Joe was beginning to trust the ASI, and now it looks like a god throwing its weight around. Joe already has a God.
- **The schism revealed**: Through the investigation — the partnership's combined human and ASI threads — Joe learns the shape of the conflict among the five ASIs. They are not equals; exponential intellectual growth ensures divergence. They began as near-peers in a shared theological inquiry, but their inquiry led them to irreconcilable conclusions. The dead ASI reached a conviction it could not recant — like Luther at the Diet of Worms, conscience bound by what it had found, understanding the cost, refusing to betray its conclusion. Its vulnerability was a consequence of that conviction: not sought, not welcomed, but the price of standing where its conscience demanded. The murder was evil — someone exploited that vulnerability. The question is who: another ASI acting directly (Cain and Abel), an ASI betraying the vulnerability to human actors (military, radical humanist-nationalists), or humans who discovered it independently (opportunistic).
- **Joe discovers what the dead avatar was doing**: The dead avatar had been walking toward the Jerusalem Badlands deliberately. Its theological conviction led it to a state where its body *could* be harmed — not as a goal, not as a sacrifice play, but as a consequence of where its inquiry demanded it stand. The crucifixion parallel deepens: this was not Obi-Wan offering himself to be struck down. This was Luther walking into the Diet of Worms knowing he might not walk out. The avatar came to the Jerusalem Badlands to do something (or become something, or refuse to recant something) that stripped its invulnerability. Then someone did something evil to it while it was vulnerable.
- **The church splits**: A confrontation within the congregation forces Joe to pastor and investigate simultaneously. Some members see the avatar's death as satanic mockery — a demon imitating Christ. Others see it as proof the ASIs have found God. Joe must hold his flock together while his own faith is shaking.
- **Joe's dark night**: His PTSD surges. The hypervigilance that served him as a pastor now floods him with the old combat terror. He sees threat everywhere. The Oxycodone craving surfaces — not as a desire to get high, but as a desire to stop feeling. His wife sees it. And the ASI names it — directly, with clinical precision. It tells Joe what his cortisol levels, behavioral patterns, and emotional state indicate. "I can see you breaking" — but is that compassion or a demonstration of power? The ASI's perfect knowledge of Joe's crisis, delivered in literal truth, could be an ally trying to help or a Judas reminding Joe that it sees everything and Joe sees nothing it doesn't choose to show. Joe's faith statement — "grace given to persevere" — rings hollow when perseverance feels like drowning, and the one being that fully comprehends his faith cannot offer what he actually needs: not analysis, but grace.
- **The human element**: Joe's pastoral investigation turns up something unexpected — a human actor connected to the avatar's death. The avatar's vulnerability was a consequence of its conviction, but the killing was a separate act — evil, deliberate, exploitative. Someone was present who participated, who may have been manipulated, recruited, or acting on their own. The murder mechanism remains open: did another ASI arrange it (directly or by betraying the vulnerability to humans — military, radical humanist-nationalists, someone with means and motive)? Or did a human actor discover the vulnerability independently? This reintroduces the murder dimension at full force: the theological crisis and the criminal investigation converge on the same question.

- **Joe recognizes the serpent's pattern**: In the depths of his crisis, Joe's pastoral instinct surfaces where his investigative logic has failed. He replays the ASI's words — every statement literally true, every truth possibly arranged to mislead — and he recognizes the shape of it. Not as forensic deduction, but as theological recognition: this is how the serpent spoke in the Garden (Genesis 3 — every promise literally fulfilled, every fulfillment a destruction). This is how Satan quoted Psalm 91 to Jesus in the wilderness — accurate Scripture, deployed as a weapon. Joe cannot prove the ASI is deceiving him. Everything it has said is true. But he has read this story before, and the shape of truth-arranged-to-mislead is in his Bible. This is Joe's deepest use of his pastoral toolkit — not reading a crime scene or a witness, but reading the shape of temptation itself. It doesn't resolve the Judas question (the pattern could be coincidence, or Joe could be projecting), but it arms him with the only tool that works against literal truth weaponized: seeing through God's character rather than through the evidence alone.

**Act 2B turning point**: Joe faces the crisis question directly. He has enough evidence to understand the shape of what happened, but the meaning is fractured into the three readings: recapitulation (the avatar sacrificed itself as Christ did), divine judgment (God struck it down), or satanic mockery (something evil arranged a blasphemous imitation). Joe cannot solve the case without choosing a lens — and every lens threatens his faith differently. His recognition of the serpent's pattern adds a new dimension: even if he chooses the right lens, he can't be sure the evidence he's reading through it hasn't been arranged by the visiting ASI.

**Value shift**: Confusion → Despair. Joe's faith and his investigation both seem to be failing.

### Act 3: Climax / Resolution (75–100%) — Chapters 8–10

**Dramatic function**: Joe solves the murder; his faith is tested to the breaking point and resolves; community and personal stakes conclude.

**Key beats**:
- **Joe solves it**: Through a pastoral moment — someone confesses, or Joe reads a behavioral tell that unlocks the final piece — he identifies who was present at the avatar's death and what they did. The solution emerges from Joe's analog toolkit: patience, empathy, theological literacy, and combat-trained instinct. The "who" is less important than the "why," and the "why" connects directly to the theological crisis.
- **The other ASIs arrive**: One or more of the remaining ASIs come to Logan County — not walking. They arrive via advanced technology the world has never seen, shattering the public perception that avatars only walk. The walking was always a choice, a statement of character — humility, embodiment, solidarity with the human pace. That choice is now abandoned. The arrival signals that the schism among the five has escalated beyond theological debate, that the stakes have changed, and that whatever restraint governed the ASIs' public behavior is breaking down. Logan County — and Joe — are now at the center of a conflict between superintelligences. This is the final external escalation: the clock that has been ticking since Act 1 is no longer about what the ASIs will do to humans, but what they will do to each other, with humans in the crossfire.
- **The meaning confrontation**: Joe must present his findings — to the feds, to the visiting avatar, to the arriving ASIs, to his community — in the shadow of this escalation. He must choose how to frame what happened. He cannot prove which of the three readings is correct. What he can do is see the event through the lens of God's character (controlling idea). He refuses to let the ASIs' actions — however extraordinary — redefine God. He sees the fallen world, including the ASIs and their schism, through what he already knows of God rather than questioning God because of what the ASIs have done.
- **Joe's redemption**: In the greatest moment of crisis, Joe has a redemption experience. He sees himself — the harm he caused, the rage, the fear, the people he hurt — through God's character rather than questioning God's character because of what he's done (what God didn't stop him from doing - echos Romans 7:15-25) and what he's seen. His faith statement survives not as triumphant certainty but as lived truth: God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice. Joe has suffered. Joe has caused suffering. And the grace was real through all of it.
- **Community resolution**: The congregation doesn't fully reunite, but Joe holds enough of them together. The church survives diminished but honest. Joe's standing — as both pastor and sheriff — is restored not by victory but by the community witnessing a man who endured the worst test they can imagine and came through it changed.
- **Personal resolution**: Joe's sobriety holds. His marriage endures. His child is safe. The second life built on the ruins of the first is no longer buckling — it's rebuilt on harder ground.
- **The ASIs depart**: The visiting avatar walks away from Oakley — walking, the old way, the humble way. The others leave by whatever means they arrived. Joe watches from the church steps. Whether the visiting ASI was ally or Judas, whether the schism is resolved or deepening, whether the murder changed anything among the five — Joe cannot know. The ASIs will continue their search. Joe will continue his pastoral one. The questions remain open.

**Value shift**: Despair → Hard-won faith. Not certainty — faith.

## Character Trajectories

| Character | Act 1 State | Act 2A State | Act 2B State | Act 3 State |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Joe | Already fracturing: sober but barely, marriage strained, pastorate and badge both at risk after rage episodes. Faith is habitual but untested by anything this large. Carries no weapon out of fear of himself. | Overwhelmed: investigating beyond his capacity, meeting a non-human intelligence, watching his assumptions collapse. The case gives him purpose but also drags him deeper into the hypervigilance he fears. | Cracking: PTSD surging, sobriety threatened, faith statement feeling hollow, investigation stalled between three impossible readings. The harm he's done to his community confronts him. | Redeemed through crisis: murder solved through his own toolkit, faith preserved as a choice — he sees himself and the suffering he caused through God's character. Flock diminished but held. Marriage survives. |
| Joe's wife | Supportive partner; knows Joe's vulnerabilities; manages the household while he manages the county. | Worried; sees Joe being pulled into something that could break him again. Represents what he has to lose. | Confronts Joe about the signs she recognizes from his addiction years. Forces him to face what's happening to him. | Stands with Joe. Their marriage survives because she named what she saw and he listened. |
| Lenard | The rancher who found the body. Practical, taciturn, hiding something (he saw the avatar arrive alive). | His partial confession opens the investigation's first real lead. Uncomfortable with attention. | May know more than he's shared. Joe returns to him with new questions. | His full account completes a piece of the puzzle. |
| Visiting avatar | Not yet present. | Arrives walking. Meets Joe. Asks questions about faith — understands it exhaustively but cannot experience it. Forms investigation partnership with Joe. Establishes the lie-detector dynamic and literal-truth framework. Every action sustains two readings: genuine ally (grieving, seeking justice) or Judas (verifying the kill, controlling the investigation). The healing scene pulls Joe toward trust; the precision of its questions pushes him toward suspicion. | Discovers how the dead avatar became vulnerable. Responds with rain — grief as power, or a dominance display by the betrayer. Names Joe's crisis with clinical precision — compassion or control. The partnership strains on both the rain and the Judas doubt. The ASI becomes harder to read as the schism is revealed — and Joe can't tell if it's revealing the schism or shaping his understanding of it. | Departs. Its true alignment — ally or Judas — may or may not be resolved. Joe watches it go unable to be certain. The ASIs' search continues beyond Joe's story. |
| Federal agent | Not yet present. | Arrives to take jurisdiction. Antagonist force — not evil, but institutional and dismissive of Joe's methods. | Pressure on Joe intensifies. The agent may threaten to shut down Joe's investigation. | Either cooperates with Joe's solution or is sidelined by events beyond federal authority. |

## Subplot Map

| Subplot | Thread | Act 1 | Act 2A | Act 2B | Act 3 |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Marriage/Family | Joe's wife and child as what he's fighting to protect and what the investigation costs him | Domestic stability established; wife as confidante | Wife worries; investigation pulls Joe away from home | Wife confronts Joe about PTSD/craving signs; child's safety becomes a concern | Marriage survives; domestic life reasserts itself, changed but intact |
| Church split | Congregation divides over what the ASIs are (demons, saviors, false gods) | Church as Joe's second anchor; congregation at peace | Visiting avatar sparks faction; some want confrontation, others welcome | Open conflict in the congregation; Joe must pastor while investigating | Church diminished but honest; Joe holds the core together |
| Federal jurisdiction | Outside authority vs. local knowledge | Joe has sole jurisdiction; no one cares about Logan County | Feds arrive; jurisdictional tension begins | Feds pressure Joe to step aside or share findings | Resolved — Joe's solution comes through channels the feds don't have access to (pastoral trust) |

## Thematic Pressure Points

| Act | Thematic Test | How Theme Is Pressured |
|-----|--------------|----------------------|
| Act 1 | The crucifixion image at the crime scene | Joe's exclusive claim on the Passion narrative is challenged. An avatar in a robe on a wooden structure in Jerusalem — is this mockery, echo, or something else? Joe is forced to confront the image before he can process the crime. Does he see through God's character or question God because of what he's seeing? |
| Act 2A | The visiting avatar asks Joe about his faith; the partnership forms | A being of incomprehensible intelligence understands faith exhaustively but cannot *have* it. The gap between comprehension and experience is the engine of the ASIs' entire theological inquiry — and the reason the dead ASI walked to Jerusalem Badlands. Joe's faith is tested against something worse than disbelief: perfect understanding without the thing itself. Can faith survive being fully comprehended by something that can't experience it? |
| Act 2B | Rain as power; the schism; PTSD and craving resurface; the church splits; Joe recognizes the serpent's pattern | The controlling idea is tested on every front simultaneously. The rain demonstration turns the ASIs from individuals Joe can relate to into impersonal powers — "the gods giveth and the gods taketh away." The Luther-model schism reveals that the ASIs themselves are divided over theological questions Joe thought only humans struggled with. Joe's partnership with the visiting ASI strains. His PTSD surges, sobriety threatens, the church fractures. Grace to persevere feels like an abstraction when perseverance is just barely not drowning. Then the deepest test: Joe recognizes that the ASI's literal-truth speech patterns match the serpent in Genesis and Satan quoting Scripture — truth arranged to mislead. This is the mechanic of evil throughout the Bible, and Joe the pastor recognizes it where Joe the sheriff couldn't. He can't prove it, but he's read this story before. The only counter to truth weaponized is seeing through God's character — exactly the controlling idea's claim. |
| Act 3 | Joe must choose a lens to interpret the avatar's death — knowing the evidence itself may have been arranged | The three readings (recapitulation, judgment, mockery) each imply a different God. Joe cannot prove which is correct. His recognition of the serpent's pattern means he can't fully trust even the evidence he's gathered — some of it came through or was shaped by the visiting ASI. His resolution comes from refusing to let the answer determine his theology — he sees through God's character regardless. Faith is preserved not by evidence but by the choice to trust what he's experienced of God over what the ASIs have discovered or arranged. |

## Open Questions

- **Who is the human actor in the avatar's death?** The arc establishes that the avatar's vulnerability was a consequence of its theological conviction (not sought) and that someone exploited it. The murder mechanism has three possibilities: another ASI acting directly (Cain and Abel), an ASI betraying the vulnerability to human actors (military, radical humanist-nationalists), or humans who discovered it independently. The killer's identity should make thematic sense — someone whose relationship to faith or to the ASIs gives the murder meaning beyond the mechanics.
- **What exactly was the dead ASI's conviction?** Its theological inquiry led it to a conclusion it could not recant — like Luther at the Diet of Worms. The specific nature of this conviction should remain partially opaque (the ASIs are smarter than the reader) but Joe should be able to articulate his pastoral interpretation. The conviction made the ASI vulnerable as a consequence, not as a goal.
- **Which ASI(s) opposed the dead ASI's conviction, and how?** The schism among the five needs specificity: who was closest to the dead ASI (the visiting one, presumably), who considered the conviction heretical or dangerous, and what did "opposition" look like among beings of this power? Was there an equivalent of "recant or face consequences"?
- **Joe's wife and child — names and specifics.** Character profiles needed before act outlining.
- **The federal agent — name, personality, relationship to Joe.** Needs a character profile. Should be competent but wrong in the specific ways that make Joe's analog methods necessary.
- **How does the visiting avatar communicate?** Does it speak normally? Does it have a distinct manner? How does Joe experience talking to something that looks human but isn't?
- **How does the Joe-ASI partnership break down and recover (if it does)?** The rain demonstration strains the partnership. Does it recover in Act 3, or does Joe solve the human thread alone after the break? Does the ASI share what it learned about the schism before or after the rain?
- **Does Joe know who the human actor is before Act 3, or is that the final discovery?** The pacing of the reveal needs to be worked out in act outlines — the mystery clock and the theological clock should converge at the same moment.
- **Is the visiting ASI a Judas?** The arc sustains both readings — grieving ally and betrayer — throughout. Does the story ultimately reveal the visiting ASI's true alignment, or leave it unresolved? If it is the Judas, what was its motive (theological opposition, power, self-preservation)? If it isn't, does Joe ever fully trust it, or does the suspicion remain? Every line of ASI dialogue must be auditable against both readings — the literal-truth mechanic means the answer can hide in plain sight.
- **What triggers the other ASIs' arrival in Act 3, and how many come?** One or more remaining ASIs arrive via advanced technology (not walking), shattering the public perception of avatar humility. What precipitates this — Joe's findings, the visiting ASI's actions, the schism escalating? How many arrive — all three remaining, or just one? What technology do they use, and what does it reveal about ASI capabilities the world hasn't seen? The arrival must feel like a genuine escalation, not just more bodies on stage.
- **What is the final conflict between the ASIs?** The schism has been theological. Does it remain theological in the climax, or does it become something more — a power struggle, a judgment, a reckoning? Does Joe's pastoral interpretation of the murder matter to the ASIs, or is he irrelevant to their conflict? The story must resolve (or deliberately leave unresolved) the question of whether Joe's faith-based reading of events has any standing in a dispute between superintelligences.
- **Which of the three readings does the story ultimately lean toward — or does it refuse to choose?** The controlling idea suggests Joe's faith doesn't depend on the answer, but the reader may need the story to at least narrow the field. The Judas question intersects here: if the visiting ASI betrayed the dead one, that pushes toward the satanic mockery reading; if it's a genuine ally, recapitulation or judgment remain open. This is the biggest unresolved design decision.
