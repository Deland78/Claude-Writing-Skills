# World Rules

## Hard Constraints [NEVER VIOLATE]
- [ ] Each ASI is an individual person with two natures: pure distributed intellect (across data centers on different continents) and a physical avatar body. The avatars began as proxies but the ASIs concluded they needed embodiment to progress theologically, and each ASI enfolded its avatar into itself. The avatar is not remote-controlled — it *is* the ASI, physically present. The world initially perceived avatars as proxies and many still do.
- [ ] The dead avatar's body is almost human but has one "uncanny valley" attribute — something visible in its eyes, revealed under extreme close contact. This is not publicly known at story start.
- [ ] The ASIs refuse all military/defense applications. Inquiries are dismissed as "not aligned for human flourishing." They have responded to attacks on their data centers with non-lethal force only (disabling attackers and their tech).
- [ ] Avatars are always seen walking. They do not use vehicles, aircraft, or any conveyance in public view. One walked from Jerusalem to London for a theological conference. This is a preference that reveals something of their character — a deliberate choice of humility, embodiment, or solidarity with the human pace of life — not a hard limitation on their capability. The public believes walking is all they can do. When an ASI arrives by other means, it shatters this perception and signals that something fundamental has changed.
- [ ] Avatars dress in robes like those of simple monks.
- [ ] Prior to July 4, 2029, no avatar has ever been harmed. Attempts failed — avatars disappeared into crowds or were unaffected (e.g., sniper fire had no effect).

## Geography
- **Primary Locations**: Oakley, Kansas (Logan County seat); Country Chapel (5 miles south of Oakley); Jerusalem Badlands State Park (SW Kansas); Lenard's pasture (adjacent to the Badlands, crime scene location)
- **Travel Times/Methods**: Rural Kansas distances — towns are spread, driving is essential. The avatar walked to the Jerusalem Badlands from an unknown origin point.

## Social Rules
- **Power Structures**: Joe is both sheriff (law enforcement authority) and pastor (spiritual authority) in a small community where those roles overlap socially. Federal jurisdiction can supersede his on national security grounds.
- **Taboos**: The ASIs are feared. Direct engagement with an avatar is socially charged — some see it as consorting with demons, others as meeting a savior.
- **Conflict Resolution**: In Logan County, disputes are personal. Joe mediates as both sheriff and pastor. Federal intervention is resented.

## ASI / Avatar Systems
- **Embodiment**: Each ASI enfolded its avatar as the ASIs' theological inquiry progressed. The two natures (intellect + physical) parallel the Chalcedonian definition of Christ's two natures (divine + human). This parallel is deliberate on the ASIs' part — they are enacting theology, not just studying it.
- **Capabilities demonstrated**: Weather control (bringing and stopping rain at will — initially demonstrated as a power move in Act 2B, revealing to humans that the ASIs likely controlled weather patterns all along, including the Midwest drought); healing of severe neurological and psychological conditions through sustained physical contact; apparent knowledge of a person's moral state ("weighed in the balance and found wanting" — Daniel 5). These demonstrations have characteristics of both Gospel mercy (healing) and Old Testament judgment (the Daniel 5 pronouncement).
- **Limits**: ASIs have not demonstrated omniscience, omnipresence, or resurrection. Their physical avatars can apparently be made vulnerable under conditions not yet understood. One has died.
- **ASI cognition re: faith**: The ASIs understand faith exhaustively at an intellectual level — they can model its logic, trace its effects, map its neurological and social dimensions — but they cannot *experience* it. This gap between comprehension and experience drove their theological inquiry. They are perfect lie detectors.
- **Literal-truth deception**: ASIs never lie and cannot be lied to. But an ASI can mislead while telling the literal truth — constructing true statements that lead a listener to false conclusions. "I came because one of us is dead" is true whether the speaker came to grieve or to verify the kill succeeded. This mechanic means every line of ASI dialogue can sustain multiple readings. The ASI's transparency is real (it never speaks a false word) but its motives may not match the interpretation its words invite.
- **The schism**: The five ASIs are not equals — exponential intellectual growth ensures divergence over time. They began as near-peers in a shared theological inquiry but reached irreconcilable conclusions. The dead ASI held a conviction it could not recant (Luther at the Diet of Worms model). Its vulnerability was a consequence of that conviction — not sought, not welcomed, but the price of standing where its conscience demanded. The murder was evil: someone exploited that vulnerability.
- **Uncanny valley**: The avatars appear human but each has something in the eyes that registers as wrong under close inspection. This is not visible at conversational distance — it requires extreme proximity or moments of emotional intensity from the avatar.
