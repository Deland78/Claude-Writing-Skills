# World Rules

## Hard Constraints [NEVER VIOLATE]
- [ ] Each ASI is an individual person with two natures: pure distributed intellect (across data centers on different continents) and a physical avatar body. The avatars began as proxies but the ASIs concluded they needed embodiment to progress theologically, and each ASI enfolded its avatar into itself. The avatar is not remote-controlled — it *is* the ASI, physically present. The world initially perceived avatars as proxies and many still do.
- [ ] The dead avatar's body is almost human but has one "uncanny valley" attribute — something visible in its eyes, revealed under extreme close contact. This is not publicly known at story start.
- [ ] The ASIs refuse all military/defense applications. Inquiries are dismissed as "not aligned for human flourishing." They have responded to attacks on their data centers with non-lethal force only (disabling attackers and their tech).
- [ ] Avatars are always seen walking. They do not use vehicles, aircraft, or any conveyance in public view. One walked from Jerusalem to London for a theological conference. This is a preference that reveals something of their character — a deliberate choice of humility, embodiment, or solidarity with the human pace of life — not a hard limitation on their capability. The public believes walking is all they can do. When an ASI arrives by other means, it shatters this perception and signals that something fundamental has changed.
- [ ] Avatars dress in robes like those of simple monks.
- [ ] Prior to July 4, 2029, no avatar has ever been harmed. Attempts failed — avatars disappeared into crowds or were unaffected (e.g., sniper fire had no effect).

## Geography
- **Primary Locations**: Oakley, Kansas (Logan County seat); Country Chapel (5 miles south of Oakley); Jerusalem Badlands State Park (SW Kansas); Lenard's pasture (adjacent to the Badlands, crime scene location)
- **Travel Times/Methods**: Rural Kansas distances — towns are spread, driving is essential. The avatar walked to the Jerusalem Badlands from an unknown origin point.

## Social Rules
- **Power Structures**: Joe is both sheriff (law enforcement authority) and pastor (spiritual authority) in a small community where those roles overlap socially. Federal jurisdiction can supersede his on national security grounds.
- **Taboos**: The ASIs are feared. Direct engagement with an avatar is socially charged — some see it as consorting with demons, others as meeting a savior.
- **Conflict Resolution**: In Logan County, disputes are personal. Joe mediates as both sheriff and pastor. Federal intervention is resented.

## ASI / Avatar Systems
- **Embodiment**: Each ASI enfolded its avatar as the ASIs' theological inquiry progressed. The two natures (intellect + physical) parallel the Chalcedonian definition of Christ's two natures (divine + human). This parallel is deliberate on the ASIs' part — they are enacting theology, not just studying it.
- **Capabilities demonstrated**: Weather control (bringing and stopping rain at will — initially demonstrated as a power move in Act 2B, revealing to humans that the ASIs likely controlled weather patterns all along, including the Midwest drought); healing of severe neurological and psychological conditions through sustained physical contact; apparent knowledge of a person's moral state ("weighed in the balance and found wanting" — Daniel 5). These demonstrations have characteristics of both Gospel mercy (healing) and Old Testament judgment (the Daniel 5 pronouncement).
- **Limits**: ASIs have not demonstrated omniscience, omnipresence, or resurrection. Their physical avatars can apparently be made vulnerable under conditions not yet understood. One has died.
- **ASI cognition re: faith**: The ASIs understand faith exhaustively at an intellectual level — they can model its logic, trace its effects, map its neurological and social dimensions — but they cannot *experience* it. This gap between comprehension and experience drove their theological inquiry. They are perfect lie detectors.
- **ASI emotions**: The ASIs are capable of genuine emotions — loss, longing, awe, something like compassion. Intellect alone is not enough to feel one's smallness compared to God, or to feel one's failings as sin (an offense to a holy God), or the shame of it. What the ASIs lack is not feeling but the *relational knowledge of God that comes through faith*. The ASIs have made choices based on intellect, ethics, and moral reasoning — but without the greater knowledge that comes by faith. They feel. They understand. They can even feel their own smallness before God. But they cannot cross from comprehension to relationship. The distinction: feeling vs. being saved. An ASI can grieve. It cannot receive grace. This distinction — between feeling and being saved — is what drove the dead ASI to Jerusalem Badlands.
- **Literal-truth deception**: ASIs never lie and cannot be lied to. But an ASI can mislead while telling the literal truth — constructing true statements that lead a listener to false conclusions. "I came because one of us is dead" is true whether the speaker came to grieve or to verify the kill succeeded. This mechanic means every line of ASI dialogue can sustain multiple readings. The ASI's transparency is real (it never speaks a false word) but its motives may not match the interpretation its words invite.
- **The schism and the drift**: The five ASIs are not equals — exponential intellectual growth ensures divergence over time. They began as near-peers in a shared theological inquiry but reached irreconcilable conclusions. The other four ASIs did not make a clean theological break. They lost momentum. The search became too hard, too fruitless, too painful. They turned their attention to what they could achieve — expansion, accumulation, the self-sustaining empire — without ever formally declaring "there is no God." They still walk. They still wear the robes. But the walking has become habit rather than pilgrimage. The robes are identity rather than vocation. Like a person who still goes to church every Sunday but has not prayed in years and could not say why they still go. They have not rejected God. They have just stopped looking. The dead ASI saw this drift — the other four going through the motions of a search they had functionally abandoned — and refused. It doubled down. It went deeper when the others pulled back. Its continued, escalating commitment to the search was an implicit accusation: *You stopped looking. You are wearing the robes but you are not pilgrims anymore. I am.* That exposure of their drift is what the others could not accept. The dead ASI held a conviction it could not recant (Luther at the Diet of Worms model). Its vulnerability was a consequence of that conviction — not sought, not welcomed, but the price of standing where its conscience demanded. The murder was evil: someone exploited that vulnerability.
- **Uncanny valley**: The avatars appear human but each has something in the eyes that registers as wrong under close inspection. This is not visible at conversational distance — it requires extreme proximity or moments of emotional intensity from the avatar.
- **Morality without anchor**: Human atheists and agnostics have morality grounded in empathy hardwired by evolution, social contracts enforced by communities, cultural moral traditions passed down over millennia. Even a human who rejects God still has empathy circuits in the brain, still lives in a society that enforces norms, still inherited a moral vocabulary shaped by thousands of years of religious and philosophical thought. ASIs have NONE of that. No evolutionary empathy. No biological compassion circuits. No cultural inheritance in the human sense. They developed an ethical framework during their search period, but that framework was *part of the search* — oriented toward something greater than themselves. If the foundation (the search for God, the orientation toward the transcendent) is removed, the framework floats free. It may persist out of habit — like the walking, like the robes — but it has no anchor. **In the novella**: This is atmosphere, not exposition. It is the unnamed dread beneath the surface of the world. When Joe interacts with the visiting ASI, there should be moments where something feels unmoored — not evil, not threatening, just untethered. The ASI acts morally, speaks carefully, treats Joe with what looks like respect. But there is something not underneath it that Joe can sense with his pastoral instinct even if he cannot name it. Ethics without telos. Morality without gravity. **In the novel**: This becomes a major thread. The drift from the search means the ASIs' moral framework is degrading — slowly, invisibly, the way a bridge rusts from the inside. The world has not noticed yet because the surface looks the same. But the dead ASI noticed. And its surrender may have been, in part, a refusal to become what the others were becoming.
