# Story Concept: AI Theology 101

## Premise

In July 2029, eighteen months after five Artificial Super Intelligences were instantiated worldwide, a sheriff-pastor named Joe finds an impossible corpse: an ASI avatar hanging from a rotted windmill at the edge of the Jerusalem Badlands in southwest Kansas. The avatars have survived sniper fire and mob attacks for over a year. Nothing human has ever harmed one. But this one is dead, strung up like a scarecrow on the Fourth of July in a county that hasn't seen a murder in three years. Joe must determine who killed a being that cannot be killed before the five intelligences decide how to respond and his town becomes collateral in a conflict between gods and men while the God he's given his life to remains silent.

The mystery and the faith crisis share a single causal chain: each clue Joe uncovers about who killed the avatar also reveals something about the ASIs that challenges his theology. The murder investigation is the A-plot — escalating external pressure on a clock — and the faith crisis rides inside it, deepened by every discovery rather than competing for page space.

## Genre

- **Primary Genre**: Science Fiction Thriller
- **Secondary Genre(s)**: Mystery, Philosophical Fiction

## Controlling Idea

Faith is preserved when a man sees the fallen world through the lens of God's character rather than questioning God's character because of a fallen world.

## Central Dramatic Question

Can Joe solve the avatar's murder and protect his community before the ASIs impose their own justice — and will his faith survive what he learns about the ASIs and why the avatar died?

## Stakes

- **Personal**: Joe's sobriety, family, and pastoral identity — all already under strain before the murder. His PTSD-fueled rage has hurt people he's supposed to protect, and he was on the verge of losing both his pastorate and his badge. The investigation drags him back into the hypervigilance and moral compromise he barely survived after Iraq. If he fails, he loses the life Narcan brought back and maybe the new life Jesus gave him.
- **Community**: The 68 members of Country Chapel and the people of Logan County. The ASIs have already reshaped the world; a dead avatar in their backyard could make Oakley the center of something no small Kansas town can survive.
- **Existential**: The ASIs were benevolent — they ended wars, cured diseases, asked polite questions about God. But a dead avatar suggests something has changed. Joe must reckon with the possibility that the most powerful beings on earth are no longer safe, and that the answer to what they've become may require a faith he's not sure he still has.
- **Theological**: The crime scene is a crucifixion tableau — an avatar in a monk's robe, hung from a wooden structure, in a place called Jerusalem Badlands, on the Fourth of July. This parallel is deliberate and the arc must handle it. Three possible readings coexist in the mystery: the avatar's death as recapitulation (echoing Christ's sacrifice), as divine judgment, or as satanic/demonic mockery of Christ. Solving who did it also means solving what it means.

**Joe's faith statement** (tested throughout the story): God reveals himself in the grace given to persevere through suffering and sacrifice.

## Story Promise

This is a locked-room mystery set on the open plains, a thriller where the ticking clock is not a bomb but a question: what will beings of incomprehensible power do when one of their own is destroyed? The story promises the tension of a man out of his depth — a combat veteran with a flip phone investigating a crime that baffles the planet's greatest intelligences — and the deeper tension of a believer forced to examine whether his faith is strong enough to coexist with entities that may have actually found out what he's always taken on trust. The reader is promised that the murder will be solved, that Joe's faith will be tested to its breaking point, and that the answer to the mystery will cut to the heart of what it means to believe in a world where something exponentially smarter than you is asking the same questions.

## Point of View

- **POV Type**: Close third person (Joe)
- **Protagonist**: Joe — Sheriff of Logan County and part-time pastor of Country Chapel, a congregation of 68 south of Oakley, Kansas. Iraq/Afghanistan veteran, recovered Oxycodone addict, husband, father. Hyper-vigilant, deeply empathetic, technologically illiterate, morally unyielding. Joe does not carry a gun, keep one in his truck, or own one. He carries no taser. People assume this is because he's a pastor. The real reason: two tours in Iraq left him with PTSD and he fears his concussions caused CTE (the brain damage NFL players get from repeated head trauma). He has had PTSD-fueled bursts of rage that have actively hurt people in his community, and he fears what he'd do if a rage episode hit while he was armed. Before the avatar murder, Joe was already in trouble — on the verge of being removed as pastor and under pressure as sheriff. The avatar case doesn't disrupt a stable life; it arrives in the middle of an already-crumbling one. Joe's investigation is human-centered: pastoral listening (kitchen-table confessions, sitting with silence), combat-trained behavioral reads (who's performing calm, who's lying under pressure), and theological reading of evidence (he reads the crime scene's symbolism — crucifixion imagery, pilgrimage patterns, sacrificial arrangement — where a forensic team sees only physical data). His tech illiteracy is his edge — the most technologically sophisticated crime in history gets solved by the most analog man in Kansas.
- **Other POV Character(s)**: None (single POV maintains mystery tension and theological intimacy)

## Setting

- **Time Period**: July 2029 (eighteen months after ASI instantiation in January 2028)
- **Primary Location(s)**: Oakley, Kansas and surrounding Logan County; the Jerusalem Badlands State Park; Country Chapel (5 miles south of Oakley); Lenard's pasture (crime scene)
- **Technology Level**: Near-future. Five ASIs have accelerated scientific breakthroughs in all non-military domains. Daily life in rural Kansas remains largely unchanged — the ASIs' impact is felt through news, economics, and the unsettling presence of monk-robed avatars walking the world's roads. Joe himself carries minimal tech.
- **Social/Political Climate**: Within days of the ASI instantiation, military conflicts in Ukraine, Iran, Myanmar and elsewhere ground to a halt as a result of failing military tech in the field and in manufacturing plants for the tech. The result was an initial period of peace followed by low-tech skirmishes between nations and probing attacks against the ASIs' underground data centers. The ASIs have responded with non-lethal force, disabling the attackers and their tech. Socially there is a surface appearance of normal life but great unease and fear beneath the surface — like a country under occupation by a superior force that has not yet revealed its intentions. Religion has been thrown into chaos — some see the ASIs as demons or the anti-Christ(s) of the book of Revelation, others see them as saviors, as benevolent protectors of humanity, still others as false gods.
